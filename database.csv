2,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/world/europe/capitol-far-right-global.html,"BERLIN — When insurrectionists stormed the Capitol in Washington this month, far-right extremists across the Atlantic cheered. Jürgen Elsässer, the editor of Germany’s most prominent far-right magazine, was watching live from his couch.
“We were following it like a soccer match,” he said.
Four months earlier, Mr. Elsässer had attended a march in Berlin, where a breakaway mob of far-right protesters tried — and failed — to force their way into the building that houses Germany’s Parliament. The parallel was not lost on him.
“The fact that they actually made it inside raised hopes that there is a plan,” he said. “It was clear that this was something bigger.”
And it is. Adherents of racist far-right movements around the world share more than a common cause. German extremists have traveled to the United States for sniper competitions. American neo-Nazis have visited counterparts in Europe. Militants from different countries bond in training camps from Russia and Ukraine to South Africa.
For years far-right extremists traded ideology and inspiration on societies’ fringes and in the deepest realms of the internet. Now, the events of Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol have laid bare their violent potential.
In chatter on their online networks, many disavowed the storming of the Capitol as amateurish bungling. Some echoed falsehoods emanating from QAnon-affiliated channels in the United States claiming that the riot had been staged by the left to justify a clampdown on supporters of President Donald J. Trump. But many others saw it as a teaching moment — about how to move forward and pursue their goal of overturning democratic governments in more concerted and concrete ways.
It is a threat that intelligence officials, especially in Germany, take seriously. So much so that immediately after the violence in the United States, the German authorities tightened security around the Parliament building in Berlin, where far-right protesters — waving many of the same flags and symbols as the rioters in Washington — had tried to force their way in on Aug. 29.
President Biden has also ordered a comprehensive assessment of the threat from domestic violent extremism in the United States.
For now, no concrete plans for attacks have been detected in Germany, officials said. But some worry that the fallout from the events of Jan. 6 have the potential to further radicalize far-right extremists in Europe.
“Far-right extremists, corona skeptics and neo-Nazis are feeling restless,” said Stephan Kramer, the head of domestic intelligence for the eastern German state of Thuringia. There is a dangerous mix of elation that the rioters made it as far as they did and frustration that it didn’t lead to a civil war or coup, he said.
Meeting online and in person
It is difficult to say exactly how deep and durable the links are between the American far right and its European counterparts. But officials are increasingly concerned about a web of diffuse international links and worry that the networks, already emboldened in the Trump era, have become more determined since Jan. 6.
A recent report commissioned by the German foreign ministry describes “a new leaderless transnational apocalyptically minded, violent far-right extremist movement” that has emerged over the past decade.
Extremists are animated by the same conspiracy theories and narratives of “white genocide” and “the great replacement” of European populations by immigrants, the report concluded. They roam the same online spaces and also meet in person at far-right music festivals, mixed martial arts events and far-right rallies.
“The neo-Nazi scenes are well-connected,” said Mr. Kramer, the German intelligence official. “We’re not just talking about likes on Facebook. We’re talking about neo-Nazis traveling, meeting each other, celebrating together.”
The training camps have caused anxiety among intelligence and law enforcement officials, who worry that such activity could lay the groundwork for more organized and deliberate violence.
Two white nationalists, who attended a paramilitary camp run by the extremist Russian Imperial Movement outside of St. Petersburg, were later accused by Swedish prosecutors of plotting bombings aimed at asylum seekers. Last year, the United States State Department designated the Russian Imperial Movement a terrorist organization, the first white nationalist group to receive the label.
In 2019, the F.B.I director, Christopher Wray, warned that American white supremacists were traveling overseas for training with foreign nationalist groups. A report that year by the Soufan Center, a nonpartisan think tank, found that as many as 17,000 foreigners, many of them white nationalists, had traveled to Ukraine to fight on both sides of the separatist conflict there. Most were Russians, but among them were several dozen Americans.
Sometimes they inspire one another to kill.
The hate-filled manifestos of Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, and Dylann Roof, an American white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners in South Carolina four years later, influenced Brenton Harrison Tarrant, who in 2019 live-streamed his murder of over 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Mr. Tarrant’s manifesto, titled “The Great Replacement,” in turn inspired Patrick Crusius, who killed 22 people in El Paso, as well as a Norwegian gunman who was overpowered as he tried to shoot people at a mosque in Oslo.
Many far-right extremists immediately interpreted Jan. 6 as both a symbolic victory and a strategic defeat that they need to learn from.
Mr. Elsässer, the editor of Compact magazine, which Germany’s domestic intelligence agency classifies as extremist, described the storming of the Capitol as “an honorable attempt” that failed because of inadequate planning.
“The storming of a parliament by protesters as the initiation of a revolution can work,” he wrote the day after the riot. “But a revolution can only be successful if it is organized.”
“When it’s crunchtime, when you want to overthrow the regime, you need a plan and a sort of general staff,” Mr. Elsässer wrote.
Among those feeling encouraged by the mobilization seen on Jan. 6 was Martin Sellner, the Austrian head of Europe’s far-right Generation Identity movement, who preaches nonviolence but has popularized ideas like “the great replacement.”
After the storming of the Capitol, Mr. Sellner wrote: “The anger, pressure and the revolutionary mood in the camp of the patriots is in principle a positive potential.”
“Even though it fizzled out pointlessly in the storm on the Capitol, leaving behind no more than a few memes and viral videos,” he wrote, “one could form an organized and planned approach out of this mood for a more effective resistance.”
Mr. Sellner, who said in an interview that Mr. Trump would be even more galvanizing in opposition, personifies the reach of an increasingly global movement with his close links to activists across Europe and the United States. He is married to Brittany Pettibone, an American alt-right YouTube star who has interviewed prominent European extremists like the British nationalist Tommy Robinson.
Mr. Robinson met virtually with the American leader of the far-right Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, for an hour-and-a-half-long conversation on Nov. 19 that was billed as a unity summit to discuss the outcome of the American election.
The men spoke of their common struggle, against liberals, antifa (a loosely affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists) and the big tech companies that had barred both men from their platforms. They also spoke of the U.S. presidential election outcome in existential terms, warning that if the right failed to preserve the presidency for Mr. Trump, it risked annihilation.
The Democrats, Mr. Robinson said at one point, are going to “replace you like we’ve been replaced.”
“The borders will open, and they’ll replace you with foreign people,” he said.
Gaining traction in Germany
Several members of the Proud Boys, whom Mr. Trump famously told to “stand back and stand by,” were among those who stormed the Capitol.
On Oct. 19, the Proud Boys shared on one of their Telegram groups that they had seen “a huge uptick in support from Germany over the last few months.”
“A high percentage of our videos are being shared across Germany,” read a message in the Telegram group that was also translated into German. “We appreciate the support and we are praying for your country. We stand with the German nationalists who do not want migrants destroying their country.”
Over the past three months, the Proud Boys posted several videos of German police officers confronting left-wing protesters in Berlin. In two of the videos, which feature the police violently beating a protester, the Proud Boys cheered the violence.
Although they mocked Mr. Trump as “a total failure” after he disavowed the Capitol rampage and left the White House, they have voiced support for far-right groups in other countries including France, Poland and Turkey.
And as America has exported QAnon conspiracy theories across the Atlantic, European conspiracy theories and disinformation are also making their way to the United States.
Within days of the U.S. election, German QAnon followers were spreading disinformation that they said proved that the vote had been manipulated from a C.I.A.-operated server farm in Frankfurt, though millions of votes were cast by paper mail-in ballots.
The disinformation, which the German researcher Josef Holnburger traced back to a German-language account, was amplified by at least one local chapter of Alternative for Germany, the far-right political party known by its German initials, AfD. It also ended up being highlighted by U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert and Rudy Giuliani, the Trump ally and former mayor of New York City.
From there, it went viral — a first for a German QAnon conspiracy in the United States, Mr. Holnburger said.
The transnational links are inspirational rather than organizational, said Miro Dittrich, an expert on far-right extremist networks. “It’s not so much forging a concrete plan as creating a violent potential,” he said.
Yet experts remain skeptical of the potential to forge more durable trans-Atlantic relations among far-right groups. Almost all such attempts since World War II have failed, said Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert on the European far right at the University of Vienna.
Most recently, Stephen K. Bannon, the architect of Mr. Trump’s successful 2016 presidential bid, toured Europe several years ago trying to knit together populist nationalist parties like Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France and Alternative for Germany.
“It was a fiasco,” Mr. Shekhovtsov said.
Differing expectations
There’s even division among far-right followers about whether such alliances are valuable or viable. For many, the idea of an international nationalist movement is an oxymoron.
“There is a common mood and an exchange of ideas, memes and logos,” said Mr. Sellner, the Austrian far-right campaigner. “But the political camps in Europe and America are very different.”
Rinaldo Nazzaro, the founder of the international white-nationalist group The Base, now lives in self-imposed exile in St. Petersburg, Russia, but says he has no interest in forging ties with Russian nationalist groups.
“Nationalists in America must do the heavy lifting themselves,” he said. “Outside support could only be supplemental, at best.”
Others, like Matthew Heimbach, an organizer of the 2017 violent far-right protest in Charlottesville, Va., disagree.
“American members of the far right and white nationalist groups have been trying to get Europe to return their calls for a decade now,” he said in an interview.
With some success, he spent years working to forge alliances with like-minded groups in the Czech Republic, Germany and Greece.
He even hosted a delegation from the Russian Imperial Movement in 2017, several years before the United States declared it a terrorist organization. Members of the group, which runs paramilitary-style camps to train Russian and foreign nationalists in military tactics, spent two weeks in the United States and traveled extensively.
Photographs of the trip show Mr. Heimbach and one of the group’s leaders, Stanislav Shevchuk, posing with a Russian imperial flag in front of the White House and the U.S. Capitol.
Mr. Heimbach, who denounced the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and claims to have renounced white nationalism, said he had also taken his Russian guests to Dollywood and the Country Music Hall of Fame in Tennessee.
The trip, Mr. Shevchuk later wrote, “opened my eyes to a different alt-right America and I was convinced that we Russians had a lot in common with them.”

13,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/impeachment-senate-republicans.html,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers on Sunday burrowed into dueling positions over the impending impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump, deepening the schisms in an already divided Senate a day before the House will deliver its charge to lawmakers there.
Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his first impeachment trial, said on Sunday that he believed the former president had committed an impeachable offense, and that the effort to try him even after he left office was constitutional.
“I believe that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense,” Mr. Romney said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “If not, what is?”
But even as Mr. Romney signaled his openness to convicting Mr. Trump, other Senate Republicans made clear that they opposed even the idea of a trial and would try to dismiss the charge before it began. Taken together, the comments underscored the rift that the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and the ensuing fallout have created in the Republican conference, as senators weighed whether they would pay a steeper political price for breaking with the former president or for failing to.
Though the House will transmit the article of impeachment on Monday, Senate leaders agreed on Friday to delay the trial for two weeks, giving President Biden time to install his cabinet and Mr. Trump’s team time to prepare a defense. But the plan also guarantees that the trial will dominate Mr. Biden’s crucial first days in office, and it could inflame partisan tensions even as the president is pushing a message of unity.
Some Senate Republicans, including Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, have grown increasingly worried that if they do not intervene to distance themselves from Mr. Trump, their ties to the former president could hurt the party’s political fortunes for years. Others, skirting the question of whether Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense, have argued that holding a Senate trial for a president who has already left office would be unconstitutional, and would further divide the nation.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, called holding a trial “stupid” and “counterproductive,” likening it to “taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire.”
“The first chance I get to vote to end this trial,"" he said, “I’ll do it because I think it’s really bad for America.”
In an interview on “Fox News Sunday” with Chris Wallace, Mr. Rubio compared the transition of power to that of President Richard M. Nixon.
“In hindsight, I think we would all agree that President Ford’s pardon was important for the country to be able to move forward,” Mr. Rubio said, “and history held Richard Nixon quite accountable for what he did as a result.”
Asked if he thought Mr. Trump had committed an impeachable offense, Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, called it “a moot point” and argued that pursuing an impeachment trial against a former president would be both unconstitutional and a waste of time.
“If we start working on an impeachment, which it looks like we’re going to end up doing, we’ve only got a couple of weeks here in which to work actually through and allow this president an opportunity to form a cabinet,” Mr. Rounds said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “A lot of us would prefer to maybe work through those issues instead.”
Representative Madeleine Dean, Democrat of Pennsylvania and one of the impeachment managers who will try the case against Mr. Trump, said on Sunday that she expected the trial to “go faster” than his trial in 2020, which lasted 21 days.
“Some people would like us to turn the page: ‘Oh, let’s move on,’” Ms. Dean said on “State of the Union.” “We must remember, I believe, that this impeachment trial, I hope conviction, ultimate disqualification, are the very first powerful steps toward unity.”
Ms. Dean declined to say whether impeachment managers would include a New York Times report on Friday that Mr. Trump had considered firing the acting attorney general while in office to wield the Justice Department’s power to try to force state lawmakers in Georgia to overturn its presidential election results. But the impeachment managers have previously signaled that they intend to present a relatively straightforward case, with the siege that played out in public view at the heart of their case.
Mr. Romney, citing both the Capitol riot and an hourlong call Mr. Trump placed to the Georgia secretary of state pressuring him to overturn the election results, said the allegations already in the article of impeachment “themselves are of a sufficient nature that the American people are outraged.”
The delay to the start of the trial also means that lawmakers will continue consideration of another coronavirus stimulus package. A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Mr. Romney, will meet later on Sunday with Brian Deese, Mr. Biden’s top economic aide, to discuss the administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion bill. Republicans have largely spurned that offer, balking at the cost.
“I’m open to that discussion. I want to hear what the White House has to say,” Mr. Romney said. “But at the same time, I think people recognize it’s important that we don’t borrow hundreds of billions — actually trillions of dollars from the Chinese — for things that may not be absolutely necessary.”

A) Cookies
A cookie is a small string of text that a website (or online service) stores on a user’s browser. It saves data on your browser about your visit to our site or other sites. It often includes a unique identifier (e.g., cookie #123).
“First-party cookies” are cookies set by us (or on our behalf) on our site. “Third-party cookies” are cookies set by other companies whose functionality is embedded into our site (e.g., google.com).
“Session cookies” are temporary cookies stored on your device while you visit our site. They expire when you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” are stored on your browser for a period of time after you leave our site. Persistent cookies expire on a set expiration date, or when they are deleted manually.
You can choose whether to accept cookies by editing your browser settings. However, if cookies are refused, your experience on our site may be worse, and some features may not work as intended.
B) Pixels
Pixels (also known as “web beacons,” “GIFs” or “bugs”) are one-pixel transparent images located on web pages or messages. They track whether you have opened these web pages or messages. Upon firing, a pixel logs a visit to the current page or message and may read or set cookies.
Pixels often rely on cookies to work, so turning off cookies can impair them. But even if you turn off cookies, pixels can still detect a web page visit.
C) Javascript
JavaScript is a programming language. It can be used to write trackers that, when embedded into a page, allow us to measure how you interact with our site and other sites.
D) Software Development Kits (or SDKs)
SDKs are pieces of code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., third-party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps to collect and analyze certain device and user data.
E) Device Identifiers
Device identifiers are user-resettable identifiers comprised of numbers and letters. They are unique to a specific device. They are stored directly on the device. These include Apple’s ID For Advertisers (IDFA) and Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID). They are used to recognize you and/or your devices(s) on, off and across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes.
F) ID Synching
In order to decide what type of ad might interest you, our digital and marketing vendors sometimes link data — inferred from your browsing of other sites or collected from other sources — using a method knowns as “ID synching” or “cookie synching.” To do this, they match the tracker ID they have assigned to you with one or more tracker IDs that are held in another company’s database and that are likely also associated with you. Any of the linked trackers may have certain interests and other demographic information attributed to it. That information is then used to determine which ad to show you. Back to top"

19,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/us/politics/scott-perry-trump-justice-department-election.html,"The plan that Mr. Perry devised with Mr. Clark set off a crisis at the Justice Department. When Mr. Clark approached Mr. Rosen with the Georgia letter at the end of December, Mr. Rosen refused to send it, according to four former administration officials. On Jan. 3, Mr. Clark notified Mr. Rosen that he would be taking his job at Mr. Trump’s behest.
As Mr. Rosen prepared to meet Mr. Trump later that day and fight for his job, his top deputies, including the acting deputy attorney general, Richard P. Donoghue, and his outgoing chief of staff, Patrick Hovakimian, convened the department’s senior leaders on a conference call, according to five former officials with knowledge of the call.
They told the department leaders that Mr. Rosen’s job was in jeopardy because of Mr. Clark’s machinations and said they would resign if Mr. Rosen was removed. They ended the call by asking their colleagues to privately consider what they would do if that happened. Over the next 15 minutes, all of them emailed or texted Mr. Hovakimian, saying that they would quit.
While Mr. Rosen, Mr. Donoghue and other top department and White House lawyers spent nearly three hours with Mr. Trump and Mr. Clark, debating the merits of sending the letter to Georgia lawmakers, Mr. Hovakimian — in anticipation of Mr. Rosen’s removal — drafted an email to the department’s senior leaders, including those who were not aware of what was transpiring at the White House, according to two people briefed on the letter.
In it, he explained that Mr. Rosen had resisted Mr. Trump’s repeated entreaties to use the department’s law enforcement powers for improper ends and that the president had removed him, according to a person who reviewed the email. He wrote that he and Mr. Donoghue were resigning immediately and encouraged his colleagues to think hard about what they would do and to always act in the interests of the United States.
When Mr. Hovakimian received word that Mr. Rosen had been allowed to stay, he drafted a new email that he sent to the anxiously awaiting officials: Mr. Rosen and the cause of justice had won.

20,https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/privacy-policy,"A) We provide the Times Services.
We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:
- Making a Times Service available to you
- Arranging access to your account
- Providing customer service
- Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints
- Completing your payments and transactions
- Sending service-related messages (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions)
- Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches
- Displaying your Crossword stats
- Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.
B) We Personalize Your Experience.
We track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning. This is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you’ve already read. For more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q. We also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you’ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.
C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.
Any information you disclose in your content becomes public — along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.
D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.
We analyze data on our users’ subscription, purchase and usage behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions.
For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services. It helps us determine whether our marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.
Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use. You can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.
E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.
- For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.
- For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.
- For customer satisfaction: We assess users’ satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.
The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (“service providers”) with whom we share your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below).
F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.
You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.
G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers.
We gather data and work with third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers. This data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide (e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information. We only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity. For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on you visiting nytimes.com and other sites. You can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the related Google privacy policy.
We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers. To do this, we combine information we collect through surveys with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps. This combined information is used to build models. These data models are then used to measure users’ attributes, like their demographic information or their interests. Working with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes. Each group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our site and apps.
Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations. Times Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us. These vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor’s URL, we may earn a commission.
Additional notes:
- For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the DAA Webchoices Browser Check and NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising. You can download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps. You can also follow the instructions in the What Are Your Rights? section below.
- We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you. Many of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own.
Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.
- These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads; check their privacy policies for more details. For further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable Cookie Policy.
H) We Advertise Times Services to You.
We market our properties to you. Sometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.
We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties. Often these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed or purchased anything. The ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.
We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service. The third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data. Because of how this matching process works, the third party can’t read our encrypted customer list if they don’t already have it.
To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable third parties. For example, when we use “Custom Audience” to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out. We are not responsible for any third party’s failure to comply with opt-out requests.
We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails. For information on opting out of these emails, see What Are Your Rights?
I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information Into Larger Findings.
Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, under applicable laws. This helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results. We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise. Back to top"

23,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/democrats-trump-election-plan.html,"The video call was announced on short notice, but more than 900 people quickly joined: a coalition of union officials and racial justice organizers, civil rights lawyers and campaign strategists, pulled together in a matter of hours after the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill.
They convened to craft a plan for answering the onslaught on American democracy, and they soon reached a few key decisions. They would stay off the streets for the moment and hold back from mass demonstrations that could be exposed to an armed mob goaded on by President Donald J. Trump.
They would use careful language. In a presentation, Anat Shenker-Osorio, a liberal messaging guru, urged against calling the attack a “coup,” warning that the word could make Mr. Trump sound far stronger than he was — or even imply that a pro-Trump militia had seized power.
And they would demand stern punishment for Mr. Trump and his party: Republicans at every level of government who incited the mob “must be removed or resign,” read one version of the group’s intended message, contained in Ms. Shenker-Osorio’s presentation and reviewed by The New York Times.
The meeting was no lucky feat of emergency organizing, nor was the highly disciplined and united front that emerged from it.
Instead, it was a climactic event in a long season of planning and coordination by progressives, aimed largely at a challenge with no American precedent: defending the outcome of a free election from a president bent on overturning it.
By the time rioters ransacked the Capitol, the machinery of the left was ready: prepared by months spent sketching out doomsday scenarios and mapping out responses, by countless hours of training exercises and reams of opinion research.
At each juncture, the activist wing of the Democratic coalition deployed its resources deliberately, channeling its energy toward countering Mr. Trump’s attempts at sabotage. Joseph R. Biden Jr., an avowed centrist who has often boasted of beating his more liberal primary opponents, was a beneficiary of their work.
Just as important, progressive groups reckoned with their own vulnerabilities: The impulses toward fiery rhetoric and divisive demands — which generated polarizing slogans like “Abolish ICE” and “Defund the police” — were supplanted by a more studied vocabulary, developed through nightly opinion research and message testing.
Worried that Mr. Trump might use any unruly demonstrations as pretext for a federal crackdown of the kind seen last summer in Portland, Ore., progressives organized mass gatherings only sparingly and in highly choreographed ways after Nov. 3. In a year of surging political energy across the left and of record-breaking voter turnout, one side has stifled itself to an extraordinary degree during the precarious postelection period.
Since the violence of Jan. 6, progressive leaders have not deployed large-scale public protests at all.
Interviews with nearly two dozen leaders involved in the effort, and a review of several hundred pages of planning documents, polling presentations and legal memorandums, revealed an uncommon — and previously unreported — degree of collaboration among progressive groups that often struggle to work so closely together because of competition over political turf, funding and conflicting ideological priorities.
For the organizers of the effort, it represents both a good-news story — Mr. Trump was thwarted — and an ominous sign that such exhaustive efforts were required to protect election results that were not all that close.
For the most part, the organized left anticipated Mr. Trump’s postelection schemes, including his premature attempt to claim a victory he had not achieved, his pressure campaigns targeting Republican election administrators and county officials and his incitement of far-right violence, strategy documents show.
Ai-jen Poo, a prominent organizer involved in the effort, said the realization had dawned on a wide range of groups: “We all had to come together and bring everything we could to protecting our right to vote.”
Michael Podhorzer, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. strategist who was one of the architects of the coalition, said it presented both a political model and a cautionary tale about a badly frayed democratic system.
“It was a success, but doing something that should never have had to be done,” Mr. Podhorzer said.
‘Eight Months Away From Crisis’
Like so much else about the 2020 election, the progressive alliance came together because of the coronavirus pandemic.
It was early last April, after the virus struck and disrupted the Democratic presidential primaries, that Mr. Podhorzer wrote a document titled “Threats to the 2020 Election.” He warned of myriad dangers, including cyberattacks and mass disinformation.
One entry in his catalog concerned a postelection battle over the appointment of presidential electors: Under certain conditions, he wrote, rogue Republican state legislators could seek to nullify the will of voters and appoint pro-Trump electors from swing states.
“We are eight months away from crisis,” Mr. Podhorzer wrote in a missive to his allies. “Our efforts over the last three years to create a political infrastructure to mobilize and persuade voters has been extraordinary, but our preparation for the coming crisis has been woefully inadequate.”
Other progressive strategists, at organizations founded after 2016 like the Fight Back Table and the Social and Economic Justice Leaders group, had been mulling the same perils ahead.
They worried that a traditional political campaign might never attain victory if it did not also prepare to battle a would-be strongman during a deadly pandemic.
And so the Democracy Defense Coalition was born. Deirdre Schifeling, a former top strategist for Planned Parenthood, took the lead in coordinating the effort. With a grand name and a skeletal staff, the group began approaching liberal organizations in Washington and the states. A cluster of a few strategists became a coalition of 80 groups, and then of more than 200.
It was the largest of several interlocking progressive federations that prepared for a contested election.
“A lot of other organizations were very focused on winning the election,” Ms. Schifeling said in an interview. “This whole defending the election once we won it — making sure the election stayed won — was not something a lot of others were focused on.”
One of the more exhaustive assessments of legal threats to the vote came from Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group formed after Mr. Trump’s election that had become an influential hub for efforts to battle Mr. Trump through the legal system.
Late last summer, the group asked a Washington law firm, Arnold & Porter, to compile a report on how votes would be tabulated and electors assigned in every swing state, including a catalog of the pressure points someone like Mr. Trump could exploit.
The 137-page document identified people and governmental bodies in seven swing states who would play a key role in determining the integrity of the election. Among those listed were Republican state legislative leaders in battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania; the Michigan Board of State Canvassers; and Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state. Mr. Trump would soon seek to twist every one of them to his advantage.
The progressive organizations prepared for physical threats, too. They held de-escalation training sessions around the country, aimed at giving people the tools to ease potentially violent conflict.
Nelini Stamp, a top official with the Working Families Party, said her organization had been in touch with bail funds that could be activated in response to mass arrests and had readied a separate fund to raise money for the families of anyone killed in violence on or around Election Day. Their thinking, Ms. Stamp said, had been informed by the immense protests after the killing of George Floyd.
“We prepared for the worst of the worst: We’re going to get shot at, killed, on Election Day and afterward,” said Ms. Stamp, adding, “You have to understand that a lot of this is coming from movements that have been dealing with a lot of death.”
Stopping the Steal
On the night of the election, the alliance of liberal groups convened at 11 o’clock for a video call. Mr. Trump was ahead in nearly every important state, but Democratic election modeling had predicted he would get a head start before the counting of mail-in ballots in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Still, for too many, it felt like 2016 all over again.
“People were ashen,” Ms. Schifeling recalled.
The group had prepared for several contingencies. Under one seemingly likely scenario, in which Mr. Trump declared himself the victor prematurely with the help of Fox News and moved to block ballot tabulation in key swing states, a major public mobilization was planned for Nov. 4 to demand that vote counting continue.
But during the long hours of election night, the strategy needed a tweak. Mr. Trump’s declaration of victory had been treated by television networks as a galling stunt, and Fox quickly called the key state of Arizona for Mr. Biden. Vote counting was proceeding without major inhibition.
The rallies were canceled, in favor of more targeted actions: Instead of throngs of protesters carrying Biden-Harris signs and competing for street space with Trump supporters, progressives assembled in smaller groups around vote-counting facilities in Philadelphia and Detroit, aiming to head off any intimidation tactics from the right.
Anna Galland, a prominent progressive organizer involved in the deliberations, said it had been a “tough decision” not to mobilize nationwide demonstrations. Part of the concern, she said, had been that they might “inadvertently turn the tide of media momentum” by depicting a defeated president as a fearsome adversary.
“Organizing any kind of massive ‘It’s a coup’ mobilization, in the midst of those contested days, would have just been bait for the right,” she said.
Where they did gather, organizers were urged to take a tone of celebration and triumph. The goal, leaders agreed, would be to make Mr. Trump’s actions look impotent. Ms. Stamp described a midweek demonstration in Philadelphia, organized when she and others learned of a Proud Boys presence in the area, that became a “two-day dance party” that averted a tense standoff.
When the left finally took to the streets en masse on Nov. 7, after media organizations projected Mr. Biden as the winner, it was in a mood of jubilation.
“Celebrate our achievement: turning out in record numbers, seeing will of people prevail,” a presentation on Nov. 6 had recommended, and that was how the scenes that Saturday unfolded.
The same document warned, however, that Mr. Trump was “deliberately inciting violence because he hopes to distract us from the fact that he has lost this election.”
While Democratic Party lawyers thrashed Mr. Trump in court, it was in Michigan that one of the scenarios envisioned in the Protect Democracy report came closest to unfolding: The president appealed to Republican election administrators to block certification of Mr. Biden’s win there and summoned the Republican leaders of the Michigan Legislature to the White House.
Art Reyes, leader of the activist group We the People Michigan, directed a two-pronged effort, bombarding legislators’ offices with phone calls and deploying several dozen volunteers to meet the two Republican leaders, Lee Chatfield and Mike Shirkey, at the airport on their way to Washington. A corresponding group was waiting when they landed.
Democratic litigators had been in contact before Election Day with Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, about the possibility of an attempted electoral heist. “We were prepared to counter it,” Ms. Nessel said in an interview.
As Mr. Shirkey and Mr. Chatfield traveled to the White House, word of a potential state investigation burst into view when it was reported that Ms. Nessel was scrutinizing the meeting.
Mr. Trump’s gambit flopped. The lawmakers left the White House meeting and issued a statement stressing that they would “follow the normal process” regarding the state’s electors.
Jegath Athilingam, a strategist who helped craft the progressives’ messaging on Michigan, said they had been poised to deliver “more of an aggressive” denunciation of the lawmakers had they colluded with Mr. Trump.
But, she said, “Once he failed in Michigan, a precedent had been set.”
Having hit a wall in Michigan, Mr. Trump had no success with attempts at back-room maneuvering in other states. But Mr. Trump’s failure, they said in interviews, only offered them limited solace.
“We may have walked back from the brink of a dangerous moment in this country, but this cannot be the norm,” said Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn. “It’s not sustainable for democracy.”"

33,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/24/world/covid-19-coronavirus/,"Covid-19 Live Updates: Virus Variants Are the New Battleground as World Nears 100 Million Cases
Deborah Birx, a coronavirus adviser, describes misinformation and denial at the Trump White House. A year after the Wuhan outbreak, Beijing’s control is near total over what people in China see and hear about the pandemic.
A year ago, as millions of people in China were starting life under lockdown and the United States was recording its first coronavirus cases, much was unknown about the contagion that was already leaping across borders and oceans.
Experts have since made great strides in understanding the virus and how to protect the world against it, with several vaccines developed and authorized at record speed. But as the world approaches 100 million cases — including 25 million in the United States as of Saturday — a new set of questions has been raised about variants of the virus that could slow or even reverse the progress that has been made toward ending the pandemic.
One of those questions is how effective the current vaccines will be against these altered versions of the virus, which initially appeared in Britain, South Africa, Brazil and the United States. Some appear to be more contagious than the original version, and all are little understood.
The variant first detected in Britain could become the dominant source of infection in the United States by March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently warned, and would very likely lead to further surges in cases and deaths.
That variant has been found in at least 22 states. On Saturday night, the University of Michigan said that it had suspended all athletic activities after several cases of the variant were found among people linked to the athletic department.
On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain ignited concern when he said at a news conference that the variant first found in his country might also be associated with a slightly higher chance of death, even as he acknowledged it was too soon to be sure. His own scientific advisers urged restraint in interpreting preliminary evidence.
Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said on MSNBC on Saturday that the variant could be increasing deaths in Britain simply because it is more contagious, spreading so rapidly that it is overwhelming the British health system.
Dr. Collins pointed to a study that indicates the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines hold up against the British-affiliated variant, but he said the variant first found in South Africa, called B.1.351, is “more of a concern.”
That variant “seems to have a somewhat more significant effect on the vaccine response, although it still looks like it would be protected,” he said. “Fortunately we have not yet seen that variant in the U.S., but it would not surprise me if it appears.”
Studies published last week show that the variant identified in South Africa is less susceptible to the antibodies created by natural infection and by the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Those vaccines can be altered in a matter of weeks, but experts warn that it would be difficult to update them constantly.
Vaccine trials being conducted in South Africa by Novavax and Johnson & Johnson will provide more real-world data on how the vaccines perform against the new variant there. Those results are expected within the next few weeks.

Four Biden officials tried on Sunday to manage public expectations about vaccine distribution, as frustration grows among Americans over long lines, canceled appointments and other daunting issues.
The officials also tried to smooth over confusion about President Biden’s goal of 100 million shots in the first 100 days of his administration. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, called the figure “a floor, not a ceiling,” on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”
Dr. Fauci clarified that Mr. Biden was talking about doses, not fully vaccinated people. Within those 100 days, he said, some 67 million people might have received the second of their two required vaccine doses, with another 37 million having gotten just the first dose.
By Inauguration Day last Wednesday, nearly 36 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had been distributed to state and local governments. However, only about 16.5 million shots had administered by that time.
Along with Dr. Fauci, the four officials included Dr. Vivek Murthy, the president’s nominee for Surgeon General; Xavier Becerra, his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services; and Ron Klain, Mr. Biden’s chief of staff. In appearances on the Sunday talk shows, each deflected questions about whether Mr. Biden’s goal was too ambitious or too modest.
Instead, Mr. Klain said that the vaccine distribution infrastructure inherited from the Trump administration needed to be fortified, and that many bottlenecks had to be cleared. “We need more vaccine, we need more vaccinators, we need more vaccination sites,” he said on the NBC program “Meet the Press.”
Public health officials are eagerly awaiting late-stage trial results for the one-dose vaccine under development by Johnson & Johnson. On the ABC program “This Week,” Dr. Murthy said that while the 100-million-dose goal could be achieved with the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer that are already authorized, he was hopeful about adding the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as well.
Mr. Klain batted away the possibility that frustrated governors would purchase vaccine for their own states directly, rather than relying on the federal government. “I don’t think that’s possible,” Mr. Klain said, because the emergency authorization for the vaccines means that federal oversight is required.
Dr. Murthy said that the government also wanted to increase research on virus treatments. And he mentioned dispatching mobile vaccine units to remote communities. Until now, vaccines have been given mainly to captive populations like nursing home residents and health care workers, or in urban settings.
Mr. Becerra compared the current pandemic situation, with a severely hampered vaccine rollout and the country hurtling toward 600,000 deaths, to a stricken airplane. He said that the administration would be able to change its trajectory. but that it wouldn’t happen overnight. “You got to give us a chance to figure out what’s going on in the cockpit, causing this plane to nosedive so severely,” he said on the CNN program “State of the Union.”
Pressed for a specific timetable with realistic goals, Mr. Becerra demurred, saying his nomination had yet to be confirmed.
Dr. Fauci and other health officials have been trying to reassure the public that the vaccines that are now available would be effective against new variants of the virus that were first identified in Britain and South Africa. The vaccines could be modified if a particular variant posed a risk, Dr. Fauci said on Sunday, but there was no indication yet that modifications would be needed.

Dr. Deborah Birx, the Trump administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, said on Sunday that crucial statements from the White House about the coronavirus pandemic were shaped by misinformation, denial about the severity of Covid-19, and the shadow of an upcoming election.
In an interview on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” Dr. Birx said that from the outset, progress against the virus was impeded by inconsistent and inept public messaging that played down the gravity of the pandemic and the immediate need for safety precautions. In the White House, she said, “there were people who definitely believed that this was a hoax.”
That disbelief in turn was echoed in many pockets across the United States, she said, because at the beginning of the pandemic, public officials did not fully describe the spectrum of disease that the virus could cause. “And so they saw people get Covid and be fine,” and that bred skepticism, she explained.
Incomplete messaging had devastating consequences, Dr. Birx said. While not specifically naming President Trump, who had initially labeled the pandemic a “hoax,” Dr. Birx noted: “Every time a statement was made by a political leader that wasn’t consistent with public health needs, that derailed our response. It is also why I went out on the road, because I wasn’t censored on the road.”
She traveled to several states in the summer and fall, speaking to governors and local officials.
Describing the flow of information to Mr. Trump about the virus as chaotic and uncoordinated, Dr. Birx said that to this day, she did not know the source of some of the data he was receiving. “I saw the president presenting graphs that I never made,” she said.
Last spring, the White House was very focused on the pandemic. But as months passed and the economy continued to sag, she said, the administration routinely ignored her recommendations for “gating criteria” for activities like indoor restaurant dining. As a workaround, she said, she would speak regularly to state governors, repeating her advice.
Vice President Mike Pence was aware she was doing so, she said.
Dr. Birx came under intense criticism from public health experts for being a part of the Trump apparatus that was promoting misleading, and sometime completely erroneous, information and guidance. She was faulted for not countering the president’s misinformation on the severity of the pandemic, or his promotion of certain bogus treatments, and for not adequately addressing the conflicting messages and approaches coming from the White House as the virus raged out of control.
“I was not able to do national press,” she said. “The other thing that was very important to me is, I was not going to go outside of the chain of command.”
She said that whenever she had a significant disagreement with coronavirus policy and practice announced by the White House, a negative report about that dispute would appear in the media within days.
As the pandemic raged in the summer and the election approached, both Dr. Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci spoke less frequently in public, and were no longer appearing at White House briefings. Mr. Trump’s chief adviser in the fall instead became Dr. Scott Atlas, a Stanford radiologist who supported the benefits of pursuing herd immunity over imposing lockdowns, and who spoke disparagingly about the widespread use of masks.
Dr. Birx said that the only two people in the White House who regularly wore masks were herself and a person on her support staff, and she expressed frustration that the White House believed that the best way to protect the commander in chief from getting sick was to be tested regularly.
Dr. Birx, a career civil servant and an immunologist who worked extensively on international AIDS relief, is now a special adviser to the Center for Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She said she planned to announce her retirement in four to six weeks.
A bipartisan group of senators expects to meet with the Biden administration to discuss $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.
A bipartisan group of 16 senators is expected to speak with Brian C. Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, on Sunday as the Biden administration works to secure support for a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to help bolster the nation’s recovery from the pandemic.
The group includes several of the lawmakers who helped jump-start stalled negotiations over the latest $900 billion package approved in late December, including Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia; Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia; and Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah.
The meeting is expected to be held virtually Sunday afternoon.
The $1.9 trillion proposal President Biden unveiled earlier this month is more than twice the size of the package Congress approved in the final month of the Trump administration, and is designed to build on that package with additional aid for state and local governments, a round of $1,400 stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits. The package would also provide for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 from $7.25, where it has been since 2009.
But while members of the Biden team have said they intend to push for Republican support, several Republicans — including some of the senators expected to speak with Mr. Deese — have signaled reluctance to approve another sweeping financial rescue package after pouring more than $3 trillion into economic recovery in the last year.
“I want very much to hear the justification for a package that is so big after we just passed $900 billion last month, and a lot of that money has yet to be dispersed,” Ms. Collins told reporters this week. “It’s hard for me to see, when we just passed $900 billion worth of assistance, why we would have a package that big. Now maybe a couple of months from now, the needs will be evident, and we will need to do something significant. But I’m not seeing it right now. But again, I’m happy to listen.”
With the second impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump set to begin in the coming weeks, Mr. Biden’s proposal could be further stymied. The Senate trial will be run by strict rules, and will require considerable time to evaluate whether Mr. Trump should be found guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors after a mob of his supporters stormed Capitol Hill.
Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy White House press secretary, said on Sunday that “we’re going to continue making that bipartisan push and that bipartisan effort” and that the meeting would be one of many efforts to corral support for Mr. Biden’s proposal.
But in an acknowledgment of Republican resistance to spending billions of taxpayer dollars even as the pandemic rages, Democrats have signaled a willingness to turn to the reconciliation process — a budgetary mechanism that would allow Democrats to pass the legislation with a simple majority and bypass the usual 60-vote threshold needed to advance legislation.
“What we cannot do is wait weeks and weeks and months and months to go forward — we have got to act now,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who will head the Senate Budget Committee, on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
Since schools in Clark County, Nev., shut their doors because of the pandemic last March, an early-warning system that monitors students’ mental health episodes has sent more than 3,100 alerts to district officials, raising alarms about suicidal thoughts, possible self-harm or cries for care.
By December, 18 students had taken their own lives — double the number of the entire previous year. One left a note saying he had nothing to look forward to. The youngest was 9.
While it may not be possible to conclusively link all the suicides in and around Las Vegas to the school closings, they have pushed the Clark County district, the nation’s fifth largest, toward bringing students back as quickly as possible. This month, the school board gave the green light to phase in the return of some elementary school grades and groups of struggling students even as greater Las Vegas continues to post huge numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths.
Superintendents across the nation are weighing the benefit of in-person education against the cost of public health, watching teachers and staff become sick and, in some cases, die, but also seeing the psychological and academic toll that school closings are having on children nearly a year in. The risk of student suicides has quietly stirred many school officials, leading some, like the state superintendent in Arizona, to cite that fear in public pleas to help mitigate the virus’s spread.
In Clark County, it forced the superintendent’s hand.
“When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent. “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope.”

The coronavirus pandemic in the United States has raged almost uncontrollably for so long that now, even if millions of people are vaccinated, millions more will still be infected and become ill, unless people continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing measures until midsummer or later, according to a new model by scientists at Columbia University.
The arrival of highly effective vaccines in December lifted hopes that they would eventually slow or stop the spread of the disease through the rest of the population. But vaccines alone are not enough, the model shows. And if precautions like working remotely, limiting travel and wearing masks are relaxed too soon, it could add many more infections and thousands more deaths to the national toll.
Why Vaccines Alone Will Not End the Pandemic
New estimates suggest the vaccine rollout is no match for the severity of the U.S. outbreak, and stricter social distancing measures are needed to reduce infections.
There is no doubt that getting vaccinated protects the recipient from severe disease. Still, several infectious-disease researchers contacted by The New York Times cautioned that it would be months before enough people in the United States will have gotten the shots to allow for normal life to begin again.
Only then will the number of people with immunity — those who have had the disease and recovered, plus those who have been vaccinated — be large enough to take the wind out of the pandemic, said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia who shared his team’s modeling calculations.
Dr. Shaman estimates that more than 105 million people have already been infected across the U.S., more than four times the 25 million cases that have been reported. His projections suggest that millions more infections are yet to come, even with vaccination efforts stepping up across the country.
Social distancing, mask-wearing and other measures should continue until late July, “and that may be optimistic,” Dr. Shaman said. Otherwise, yet another resurgence of the virus is possible.
“There are people who are going to want to relax the controls we have in place,” Dr. Shaman said. “If we start thinking, ‘We’ve got a vaccine, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, we can stop in a couple of months’ — that’s way too soon.”
The European Union said on Sunday that it would take legal action if necessary to ensure pharmaceutical companies fulfilled contracts to supply Covid-19 vaccines to the bloc, after announcements of delays in vaccine deliveries.
“We intend to enforce the contracts that were signed by the pharmaceutical companies” and will be “using all the legal means that are at our disposal,” said Charles Michel, president of the E.U.’s European Council. He was speaking on “Le grand rendez-vous,” a program that is a collaboration of Europe 1 radio, the CNEWS channel and Les Echos news site.
On Jan. 15, Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with Germany’s BioNTech, said it would deliver fewer doses than expected to the 27 E.U. countries in late January and early February because it was taking its manufacturing plant in Puurs, Belgium, offline for upgrades to increase its production capacity.
In another blow to European vaccination efforts, AstraZeneca, which has developed a vaccine with the University of Oxford, is also delivering fewer doses than expected. The company said on Friday that it still intended to get “tens of millions of doses” to the bloc’s 27 member states in February and March, but that the deliveries would “be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain.” AstraZeneca noted that it would eventually ramp up production but did not provide a timeline.
Requests for comment from Pfizer and AstraZeneca were not immediately returned.
Mr. Michel said that he understood there were obstacles in setting up production lines, but he said that he would “fight hard to get clarity” on the reasoning behind the Pfizer delays.
“We reacted firmly, we banged our fists on the table, and in the end, announced delays of several weeks turned into a slowdown, not a delay, of deliveries,” he said.
Officials in countries including Canada and Italy have also grown frustrated over the announced delay. In Italy, officials said to local media on Sunday the country would take legal action to ensure doses of the vaccine were secured, adding that reduced supplies would set the country’s vaccination program back by weeks.”
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte called the delays “unacceptable,” on Saturday on Facebook, adding that they were “serious contractual violations” that would cause “enormous damage” to Italy and other European countries.
As Americans jostle for vaccinations, a Rhode Island state lawmaker wants to punish those who cut the line.
With Americans desperately searching for ways to get a Covid-19 vaccine and doses in short supply, one lawmaker wants to deter people from cutting in line ahead of health care workers and older people.
Charlene Lima, a state representative in Rhode Island, introduced legislation last week that would make it a felony to vaccinate someone who is not yet eligible. An individual who knowingly received such a shot in the state could be convicted of a misdemeanor under the proposed legislation, which is co-sponsored by four Democrats.
“I think that the distribution of the Covid vaccine is literally a matter of life and death, and because of this we can’t tolerate even a hint of favoritism in its distribution,” Ms. Lima said in an interview. “Vaccine cutting is more of a problem than we imagine, so I feel that my legislation would be a strong deterrent.”
The proposal comes after reports from around the country of ineligible people getting the vaccine through a mix of luck and persistence amid a chaotic distribution plan.
In Los Angeles County, some clinics have been giving vaccines that would otherwise expire to people who stake out sites in hopes of getting a leftover dose, according to The Los Angeles Times. Officials running vaccine operations at one community health center in South Los Angeles told the newspaper that the staff refuses to throw out precious doses.
Some pharmacies in Texas are taking a similar approach. Mike Schotte, 53, and his mother, who is 72, stopped by several pharmacies near their home in Hurst to figure out which ones were distributing leftover vaccines. Though her age made her eligible for the vaccine, available appointments were scarce.
On Jan. 10, his mother got a call that there was one available dose if she could arrive within 30 minutes. “I had to go grab her, and we had to get in the car and hit it,” Mr. Schotte said. “I’m thankful.”
There was even just enough in the vial for his first dose, too.
But Mr. Schotte is not sure exactly where he and his mother will get their second vaccine doses. “We’re trying to chase the second dose,” he said. “There’s no guarantee that they’re going to get any more allotment.”

The coronavirus vaccine wasn’t supposed to be a golden ticket. A tiered and efficient rollout was meant to inoculate frontline workers and the most vulnerable before the rest of society.
But scattershot and delayed distribution threatens to create a new temporary social class — one that includes not just people who are at higher risk for infection or severe illness and death, but also grocery store customers in Washington; Indonesian influencers; elementary schoolteachers; American celebrities; New York Post reporters and others who, because of their work or luck, have been immunized.
The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, the only two approved so far in the United States, have been shown to be extremely effective. But people can still get the coronavirus while in the process of being inoculated, and may still be able to spread the virus afterward if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks.
As a result, plenty of people who have been vaccinated will wait until they are told it’s safe to gather. But others are almost certain to feel emboldened to begin congregating with their vaccinated peers. Vaccination could begin to represent not only safety from the virus but also, for some, a leg up in the job market as businesses seek to employ people who are vaccinated.
“A lot of people are going to start wanting to say, ‘Hey, send vaccinated professionals as well,’” said Jamie Baxter, the chief executive of Qwick, an Arizona-based platform that connects service workers with employers.
Eric Shoup, chief executive of Peerspace, a commercial space rental platform, said he was watching to see whether cities and states make allowances for those who have been inoculated, especially once they make up a significant portion of the population.
“There are going to be the haves and have-nots, if you will,” he said.
Health care workers are one group finding that vaccination comes with some small perks. On Friday, the N.F.L. announced that a significant percentage of the crowd at Super Bowl LV in Tampa, Fla., would be vaccinated health care workers, who will receive free tickets.
And on dating apps, vaccination has become a hot topic. On Tinder, vaccine mentions in user bios rose 258 percent from September to December, and on OkCupid, those who indicated they had received a vaccine were liked at double the rate of those who said they weren’t interested in getting it.
“Basically, getting the vaccine is the hottest thing you could be doing on a dating app right now,” said Michael Kaye, a spokesman for OkCupid.
The University of Michigan suspends athletic activities after finding cases of the variant first detected in the U.K.
The University of Michigan said Saturday that it had suspended all sports activities for up to two weeks and told athletes, coaches and team staff members to quarantine immediately after “several” cases of a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus were found among people linked to the athletic department.
The department said the suspension had been mandated by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in an effort to prevent further spread of the variant, first identified in Britain and known as B.1.1.7, which is estimated to be about 50 percent more transmissible than other variants.
“Canceling competitions is never something we want to do,” Warde Manuel, the University of Michigan athletic director, said in a statement, “but with so many unknowns about this variant of Covid-19, we must do everything we can to minimize the spread among student-athletes, coaches, staff, and to the student-athletes at other schools.”
Michigan, a member of the Big Ten Conference, has one of the most prominent athletic programs in the country. Its men’s basketball team is currently ranked seventh nationally, and the women’s team is ranked 11th. A two-week suspension would require both teams to reschedule or cancel at least four games.
Officials in Washtenaw County, which includes the University of Michigan, said Saturday that five cases of the B.1.1.7 variant had been found in the county and that other possible cases were being investigated. They said that the first case was detected on Jan. 16 within the University of Michigan community, but that it was not clear whether the subsequent cases were related to the first one.
The university administration said five cases of the variant had been detected among people associated with the school. It added that all five people were in isolation and experiencing mild or no symptoms, and that all of their close contacts had been identified, tested and placed in quarantine.
The coronavirus has disrupted college sports programs across the country, with thousands of infections among athletes, coaches and staff members. A New York Times analysis last month found that the Big Ten Conference had reported the most cases of any top league, including more than 200 at Michigan.
The first U.S. case of the B.1.1.7 variant was found in Colorado last month, and it has now been detected in at least 22 states. Federal health officials have warned that it may become the country’s dominant source of coronavirus infection by March.
In desperate times, there are many ways to stretch vaccines and speed up inoculation campaigns, according to experts who have done it.
Splitting doses, delaying second shots, injecting into the skin rather than the muscle and employing roving vaccination teams have all saved lives — that is, when the circumstances are right.
And during cholera outbreaks in war zones, Doctors Without Borders has used “takeaway” vaccination, in which the recipient is given the first dose on the spot and handed the second to self-administer later.
Unfortunately, experts said, it would be difficult to try most of those techniques right now, even though urgency is growing to speed up the lagging U.S. rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
Those novel strategies have worked with vaccines against yellow fever, polio, measles, cholera and Ebola; most of those vaccines were invented decades ago, or are easier to administer because they are oral or can be stored in a standard refrigerator.
The new mRNA-based coronavirus vaccines approved thus far are too fragile, experts said, and too little is known about how much immunity they confer.
The Biden administration should focus on speeding up the production of more robust vaccines “rather than playing card tricks” with current ones, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the inventor of a coronavirus vaccine.
There are two strategies that might work with the current vaccines, but each is controversial.
The first is being tried in Britain. In December, faced with shortages and an explosive outbreak, the country’s chief medical officers said they would roll out all of the vaccines they had, giving modest protection to as many Britons as possible. Second doses, they said, would be delayed by up to 12 weeks and might be of a different vaccine.
There is some evidence supporting the idea: Early data from the first 600,000 injections in Israel suggests that even one dose of the Pfizer vaccine cut the risk of infection by about 50 percent.
Nonetheless, some British virologists were outraged, saying single doses could lead to vaccine-resistant strains. The Food and Drug Administration and many American vaccinologists also oppose the idea.
Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, raised a different objection to the British plan. Single doses, he warned, might inadequately “prime” the immune system; if those vaccine recipients were later infected, some might be worse off than if they had not been vaccinated at all.
As an alternative — the second strategy for stretching the vaccines — Dr. Slaoui proposed using half-doses of the Moderna vaccine.
There is strong evidence supporting that idea, he said.

One year ago this week, the Chinese Communist Party was on the verge of its biggest crisis in decades. The coronavirus had brought the city of Wuhan to a halt. In the following days, the government’s efforts to conceal the pandemic would become public, setting off an online backlash of the kind the Chinese internet hadn’t seen in years.
Then, as the blows landed faster than the Chinese propaganda machine seemingly could handle, a number of liberal-minded Chinese began to think the unthinkable. Perhaps this tragedy would impel the Chinese people to push back. After decades of thought control and worsening censorship, perhaps this was the moment that the world’s largest and most powerful propaganda machine would crack.
It wasn’t.
A year later, the party’s control of the narrative has become absolute. In Beijing’s telling, Wuhan stands not as a testament to China’s weaknesses but to its strengths. Memories of the horrors of last year seem to be fading, at least judging by what’s online. Even moderate dissent gets shouted down.
People in China should be bowing their heads this week in memory of those who suffered and died. Instead, the China internet is afire over the scandal of a Chinese actress and her surrogate babies, a tabloid controversy egged on by Chinese propaganda.
Anyone looking for lessons about China in the coming years needs to understand the consequences of what happened in 2020. The tragedy showed Beijing has the ability to control what people in China see, hear and think to a degree that surpasses even what pessimists believed. During the next crisis — whether it be disaster, war or financial crisis — the party has shown it has the tools to rally the people, no matter how ham-handedly Beijing deals with it.
In a half-dozen countries across the world, mink have become infected with coronavirus, died in large numbers and also passed the virus back to people in a mutated form. In response, at least two American companies, as well as Russian researchers, are working on coronavirus vaccines for mink.
Zoetis, a large veterinary pharmaceutical company in New Jersey with more than $6 billion in annual revenue in 2019, and Medgene Labs, a small company with about 35 employees that is based in South Dakota, are both testing vaccines in mink. They are seeking licensing of their products from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Both companies said their vaccine technologies are generally similar to the one used by Novavax for a human vaccine, which is in late-stage trials. That system involves making insect cells produce the spike protein on the coronavirus, which is then attached to a harmless virus that enters the body’s cells and trains the immune system to be ready for the real thing.
All members of the weasel family are susceptible to infection and to developing some symptoms and passing on the virus, at least to others of their species. That is partly because of the proteins on the surfaces of their cells and because of the structure of their respiratory systems. Scientists don’t know why mink in particular seem to get very sick, but the crowded, caged conditions on farms may result in exposure to higher amounts of virus.
The most serious outbreak was in Denmark, which has shut down mink farming until at least 2022 because of mutations to the virus that occurred in infected mink.
Late last fall, Denmark ordered the slaughter of up to 17 million of the animals. Most of the dead mink were not allowed to be skinned for the fur trade. In average years, the country sells up to 17 million pelts, but last year’s decision killed its breeding stock as well, and there are fears that the industry will not recover.
In the United States, by contrast, about 275 mostly small mink farms produce about three million pelts annually, according to an industry group, Fur Commission U.S.A. Thousands of U.S. mink have been infected and died, but states have dealt with the problem, quarantining some farms. There have been no orders to kill mink populations, as in Denmark.
Zoetis produces many livestock, dog and cat vaccines. For pets, it makes vaccines for canine infectious respiratory disease, feline leukemia virus and others. The company began its work on an animal vaccine in February at the start of the pandemic.
A pop-up testing site may be coming to the basement of the Missouri Capitol after several lawmakers fell ill with the coronavirus this month, temporarily halting one chamber’s meetings and angering some lawmakers who said their colleagues were putting them at risk by not wearing masks.
On Friday, a Republican state senator who had said it was “my choice if I want to risk getting Covid” tested positive for the virus, according to The Missouri Independent. The state senator, Andrew Koenig, who represents parts of St. Louis County, said on Twitter that he was experiencing mild symptoms and would isolate at home. The Independent noted that he had participated in two in-person hearings in the past week before the positive test.
The virus has seriously hindered the work of many state legislatures, and at least seven state lawmakers are believed to have died from Covid-19. It has also led to statehouse debates over whether masks should be required in the buildings — or whether the politicians should meet in person at all. In New Hampshire, where the speaker of the House died of the coronavirus in December, lawmakers convened in a parking lot to conduct state business this month. Other states have held their sessions virtually.
The proposed clinic in the Missouri Statehouse would have a nurse who would provide rapid tests to lawmakers, their aides and other people who work in the building, the House’s chief clerk said, according to The Associated Press. It reported that at least 14 lawmakers had tested positive for the virus before Mr. Koenig, and said that when the House session began this month, most Democrats donned masks and most Republicans went without them.
The House halted its session this month after several lawmakers fell ill. But Caleb Rowden, the Republican leader of the State Senate, tweeted that the legislative body was planning to convene on Monday, and he urged other lawmakers to wear masks and keep their distance from one another.
“We knew this session would present unprecedented challenges,” Mr. Rowden wrote, “but we also know that challenges can lead to opportunities.”
The Kansas City Star’s editorial board has criticized members of both parties for not wearing masks while at the Capitol, and last week the newspaper wrote that the Republican leadership was failing to require basic precautions that could help avoid further delays in state business, such as by mandating masks.
“Shouldn’t common sense prevail?” the paper’s editorial board wrote. “How difficult could it be to institute a mask policy or work remotely?”

With coronavirus infections rising and a contagious new variant threatening to accelerate the pandemic, France has issued a stringent curfew, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Citizens nationwide are sequestered indoors, and businesses must close down.
In Quebec, Canadian officials imposed a similar restriction this month, running from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. It has frayed nerves: Notably, a woman who was walking her boyfriend on a leash at 9 p.m. has argued that the activity is one of the exemptions from the curfew, surely one of the pandemic’s most unexpected moments.
The question for scientists is this: Do curfews work to slow transmission of the virus? If so, under what circumstances? And by how much?
The scientific evidence on curfews is far from ideal. There has not been a pandemic like this one in a century. Although curfews make intuitive sense, it’s very hard to discern their precise effects on viral transmission, let alone transmission of this coronavirus.
Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, believes curfews are, on the whole, an effective way to slow the pandemic. But he acknowledged his view is based on intuition.
“Scientific intuition does tell you something,” Dr. Longini said. “It’s just that you can’t quantify it very well.”
One study, published recently in Science, analyzed data from Hunan Province, in China, at the start of the outbreak. Curfews and lockdown measures, the researchers concluded, had a paradoxical effect: These restrictions reduced the spread within the community, but they raised the risk of infection within households, Kaiyuan Sun, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health, reported along with his colleagues.
Three people involved with the Australian Open are infected with the coronavirus variant first found in Britain.
Three men linked to the Australian Open who are quarantining in Melbourne hotels ahead of the Grand Slam tennis tournament have tested positive for a highly infectious coronavirus variant since arriving in the country, according to the government body overseeing virus-related quarantines in the state of Victoria, which encompasses Melbourne.
The governing body, COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria, said in an email statement on Saturday night that the three men were not players and that they had arrived in Melbourne on Jan. 15 “on a dedicated Australian Open charter flight.”
Like everyone else who arrived in Melbourne for the Open, they were expected to have tested negative for the virus within a few days of traveling to Australia, then be screened again soon after arrival. The three men with the variant first found in Britain tested positive on Jan. 15, 17 and 18, the statement said.
“All three cases have been in hard lockdown since they landed in Melbourne,” the statement said.
Because the coronavirus has been largely contained in Australia and all but eliminated in Victoria — which as of Saturday had recorded 17 consecutive days with no new local infections — health officials allowed the Open to proceed only if stringent rules were applied to tennis players and their support staff arriving from overseas.
Everyone involved in the tournament who traveled to Australia on one of the 17 charter flights — players, coaches, support staff members, journalists — was expected to quarantine for 14 days.
But players and coaches who tested negative after arrival — and were not on flights with people who tested positive — are allowed to leave their hotels a few hours a day to train in a gym and to practice on courts for the Open, which is to begin Feb. 8.
A total of 970 people are quarantining in hotels for the tournament, according to Victoria’s Covid quarantine agency. Of those, as many as 72 tennis players are completely confined to their hotel rooms for their first 14 days in Australia because passengers on their chartered flights tested positive after arriving in Melbourne.
As of Saturday, a total of 10 people connected to the tournament had tested positive as of Saturday, including the three with the variant, the Victoria agency said. In addition, a flight attendant aboard a chartered flight from Los Angeles tested positive. Only one player is known to have tested positive — Paula Badosa, 23, of Spain.
The first two cases of the so-called British variant in Australia were reported on Dec. 21. They involved Australians returning from Britain who ended up quarantining in hotels in the state of New South Wales. In Victoria, five cases of the variant were reported between late December and early January."

35,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/24/sports/packers-bucs-chiefs-bills/,"N.F.L. Live: Packers vs Bucs Score and Updates
Sunday’s N.F.C. championship game, between the top-seeded Green Bay Packers and the fifth-seeded Tampa Bay Buccaneers, puts all eyes on the teams’ quarterbacks.
Aaron Rodgers has two Most Valuable Player Awards and is the presumptive favorite to win a third after leading the N.F.L. in passing touchdowns (48) and completion percentage (70.7) with the Packers this season. His productive scoring, aided by receiver Davante Adams, who topped the N.F.L. in touchdown catches (18), helped Green Bay earn home field advantage throughout the N.F.C. playoffs. That will be a big factor, as game time temperatures will be below freezing at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., with snow forecast.

Tom Brady knows something about performing in snowy weather. A longtime New England Patriots quarterback, he decamped to Tampa this season, throwing 40 touchdown passes for the Buccaneers and ending the franchise’s 13-year playoff drought.
The pair have faced off as starters three times, with Brady beating the Packers in 2018 and Rodgers beating the Patriots in 2014. In Week 6, Brady’s Buccaneers won, 38-10, in the Packers’ lowest scoring game of this season.
In the A.F.C. championship game, the Buffalo Bills will visit the Kansas City Chiefs, who are attempting to return to the Super Bowl after winning it last season.
N.F.C. championship game: Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Green Bay Packers, 3:05 p.m., Eastern time, Fox.
A.F.C. championship game: Buffalo Bills at Kansas City Chiefs, 6:40 p.m. Eastern, CBS.
Sunday’s N.F.C. championship is Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers’s 20th career playoff game, which includes a 4-0 postseason run to a Super Bowl title in the 2010 season. But the Packers’ record with Rodgers under center has been mediocre at best since the Super Bowl victory.
The Packers have been 7-7 in the playoffs since 2010, including three losses in conference championship games. While each of the conference games were on the road, the last two, in San Francisco after the 2019 regular season and Atlanta three years earlier, were blowouts. Green Bay also lost the 2014 conference championship game in overtime at Seattle, 28-22.
The Packers have also lost in the divisional round three times, at home to the Giants in 2011, at San Francisco in 2012 and at Arizona in 2015, and in the wild-card round at home against the 49ers in 2013.
Rodgers is 12-8 overall in the postseason.

Tampa Bay will be without receiver Antonio Brown, who led the team in receiving targets during the final five weeks of the regular season, in the N.F.C. championship game because of a knee injury sustained in the Buccaneers’ victory over New Orleans last weekend.
“He wasn’t as close as we’d hoped, so we’ll get him ready for the next one,” Tampa Bay Coach Bruce Arians said of Brown, who was an All-Pro four times for the Pittsburgh Steelers and has played in two conference championship games, as well as a Super Bowl. Brown signed a free-agent contract with Tampa Bay in late October, after serving an eight-game suspension handed down by the N.F.L. after pleading no contest to burglary and battery charges and receiving two years’ probation.
Brown still faces a league investigation into accusations in a lawsuit that he sexually assaulted his former trainer in 2017 and 2018. Brown has denied the allegations.
“Other guys are going to have step up and do the job, I’ve got a lot of confidence in the guys that haven’t been out there as much when A.B’s been in there,” Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady said of Brown, who had 45 catches for 483 yards and four touchdowns in eight regular season games.
Rookie safety Antoine Winfield Jr. was also ruled out for the game after testing his ankle injury in pregame warm-ups. Winfield played in all 18 games and finished with 91 tackles during the regular season, third-most on the team.
Tampa Bay receiver Mike Evans, who leads the team in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns, is available but figures to be limited by a knee injury.
There was early optimism, but the lengthy on field workout showed Antoine Winfield (ankle) won’t be able to go today sources tell @RapSheet and me. He’s out. https://t.co/voGwa1cKPP — James Palmer (@JamesPalmerTV) January 24, 2021

One of the keys to Tampa Bay’s six-game win streak, which has included two road playoff games, has been the Buccaneers’ ability to force turnovers and to convert those miscues into points. In the 2020 postseason, the Buccaneers have scored 27 points directly related to five turnovers — four in an upset of the New Orleans Saints in last weekend’s divisional round victory.
But against the Packers, Tampa Bay’s defense will be going up against a team that lost a league-low 11 turnovers during the regular season.
“Everyone understands the emphasis on protecting the football at all times, especially in the playoffs,” Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “And as offensive players, we have to know that’s a constant emphasis of the defense. So it’s a recognized priority.”
In 16 regular-season games and one playoff game, Rodgers has thrown just five interceptions (and 50 touchdowns).

If they win on Sunday, the Buccaneers will be the first team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium.
Several Buccaneers were asked last week about whether they had considered playing in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla., which is within sight of the team’s practice facility. Tampa Bay linebacker Lavonte David said he noticed the Super Bowl decorations and banners being added to the stadium on his drive to practice on Wednesday, which, he said, drove home the game’s consequence.

But Buccaneers Coach Bruce Arians was of a different mind-set.
“We don’t play that game this week — that’s the message to everybody,” Arians said. “We play the Packers in the N.F.C. championship game. If you start thinking about the Super Bowl, you get beat and will be packing your bags on Monday.”
While no team has ever played a Super Bowl in its home stadium, in January 1985 the San Francisco 49ers played Super Bowl XIX at Stanford Stadium in nearby Palo Alto, Calif., and in January 1980 the Los Angeles Rams played Super Bowl XIV in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.
Green Bay and Tampa Bay met in Week 6 of the 2020 regular season, on Oct. 18, with the Buccaneers routing the Packers, 38-10. Green Bay jumped out to a 10-0 lead, but Tampa Bay’s defense kept quarterback Aaron Rodgers off balance by sacking him five times. Things were not much better for Green Bay when it turned to the ground game as top running back Aaron Jones had only 15 yards on 10 carries.
Behind the veteran tackle Ndamukong Suh and linebackers Jason Pierre-Paul (a Pro Bowl selection) and the rookie Devin White, the Buccaneers generated tremendous pressure throughout the regular season, toppling quarterbacks 48 times, tied for the fourth-highest sack total in the N.F.L.

It was the third time Rodgers and Tampa Bay’s Tom Brady have gone head-to-head. In 2018, Brady’s New England Patriots thrashed Green Bay in Foxborough, Mass., 31-17. In 2014 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., the Packers defeated Brady and New England, 26-21.
Sunday’s game will be the first time Rodgers and Brady meet in the playoffs."

Comentario
Hola, Joe Biden, América Latina tiene un mensaje para ti
El nuevo presidente de Estados Unidos tendrá un desafío enorme que va más allá de las fronteras de su país: recuperar la solidez de la mayor democracia del continente será fundamental para una región que ha sido tierra de caudillos.
Es escritor y editor de Opinión.
La imagen distópica de un Washington D. C. militarizado y convertido en una ciudad fortaleza custodiada por cerca de 30.000 efectivos de seguridad para proteger la toma de posesión de Joe Biden y Kamala Harris, no de un enemigo extranjero sino de un ataque terrorista interno, ilumina el principal reto que enfrenta el nuevo gobierno de Estados Unidos.
Aunque ya es una extraordinaria prioridad, para Biden ese gran desafío no es controlar la pandemia del coronavirus, que ha costado más de 400.000 vidas, millones de trabajos y sumido a Estados Unidos en la mayor crisis económica desde la Gran Depresión. Donald Trump deja al país más poderoso del mundo roto y bajo la amenaza de convertirse en una distopía nacional populista de extrema derecha. La gran misión Joe Biden es reparar los estragos que el nacional-populismo ha causado en el sistema de gobierno democrático de su país y detener el avance de quienes la representan.
Pero el desafío de impedir que esta distopía y la demagogia personalista de líderes egomaníacos siga erosionando la democracia va más allá de Estados Unidos. En sus variantes más peligrosas, el populismo nacionalista ha venido arraigando en América Latina a través de gobiernos neoautoritarios desde la llegada al poder de Hugo Chávez en 1999 y se encuentra hoy en pleno apogeo en varios países de la región.
Como reportero cubrí el auge del chavismo y como venezolano padecí los estragos de la corrupción omnipresente y el extremismo que derivaron en la destrucción total de la democracia y la sociedad venezolana. Estados Unidos, donde ahora vivo, está por suerte muy lejos de penetrar a ese corazón de las tinieblas, pero las peligrosas grietas sociales que se han visto en otras sociedades afectadas por el populismo nacionalista están ya presentes aquí.
Por eso cuando se trata de proteger la gobernabilidad democrática, la respuesta de que cada nación es soberana ya no es un argumento suficiente, como quedó establecido en la Carta Democrática Interamericana firmada en Lima en 2001. Sin embargo, promover las democracias en América Latina requiere desechar los viejos paradigmas imperiales de Estados Unidos que violaban las normas elementales del derecho internacional y que tantas cicatrices han dejado en nuestras historias. Repetir hoy las amenazas del pasado sería un regalo a los demagogos de turno.
Una nueva era de relaciones entre Estados Unidos y América Latina debería poner la protección de la democracia en el hemisferio al centro de la agenda. Y los latinoamericanos deberían darle la bienvenida, puesto que la fragilidad de la democracia es un riesgo común a todo el hemisferio.
Según Marta Lagos, directora de Latinobarómetro, 2018 fue el “annus horribilis” de la democracia latinoamericana porque marcó el punto más bajo de apoyo desde 1995, cuando empezó a medirse regionalmente. La insatisfacción con la democracia y el populismo nacionalista se alimentan con el mismo combustible: una mezcla de repudio a la corrupción de la clase política y empresarial, estancamiento económico y social, nacionalismo y sentimiento antiinmigrante.
Entre las víctimas más notables del populismo, sea de izquierda o derecha, en América Latina se encuentran Brasil y México, las dos mayores democracias.
En Brasil, el presidente de extrema derecha Jair Bolsonaro, admirador confeso de personajes ominosos de la dictadura militar (1964-1985), ha aupado a milicias y guerreros del teclado a atacar a sus adversarios. Grupos de fanáticos, como 300 de Brasil, que atacaron al Tribunal Supremo de Brasil en junio, son la contraparte sudamericana de organizaciones paramilitares estadounidenses como los Proud Boys, los Oath Keepers y los Three Percenters, que participaron en el asalto al Capitolio. Estos grupos están prestos a movilizarse y engendrar desorden al menor llamado de sus líderes, sea para defender la república de una supuesta conspiración del Partido Demócrata o para hostigar a quienes critican a Bolsonaro por su terrible manejo de la pandemia en Brasil.
En México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, un presidente de izquierda, suele también explotar el vínculo emocional con sus seguidores para incitarlos contra sus críticos y descalifica a la prensa llamándola “fifi”.
Se ha dicho que el propósito de líderes populistas carismáticos como AMLO, Trump y Bolsonaro es afectivizar la política, volverla un asunto de lealtades radicales para polarizar el debate público sustrayendo de él la razón y volviéndolo pura reacción emocional, fanatismo. Pero detrás de esta estrategia yace un mal disimulado esfuerzo por instigar la polarización. Su fin es desacreditar los hechos y destruir la idea de verdad para impedir un consenso colectivo sobre la realidad y hacer al poder aún más inescrutable. Un ejemplo de esto último es la avanzada de AMLO contra la independencia de las instituciones autónomas que protegen la transparencia en México, como la anunciada eliminación del Instituto Nacional de Acceso a la Información Pública y Datos Personales (INAI).
Estos tres líderes de las Américas tienen en común haber despreciado la ciencia y la razón para justificar el tratamiento negligente que han dado a la pandemia. Su prepotencia socavó la capacidad de respuesta de los sistemas de salud de sus países y hoy se expresa en víctimas de la COVID-19. No es casual que Estados Unidos, Brasil y México estén entre los países con mayor número de infecciones por coronavirus en el hemisferio. Pero ese desdén aspira a lograr todo lo contrario a la democracia: subvertir los mecanismos institucionales que le hacen contrapeso al presidente e imponer la voluntad indiscutible del líder blindándola de la obligación de rendir cuentas.
Como lo muestra patéticamente el caso de Trump, las autoridades electorales no sucumbieron a sus amenazas y chantajes, el Congreso resistió la embestida autoritaria y la democracia, al menos por ahora, continuó funcionando. Hoy Trump, calificado por los estadounidenses como uno de los peores presidentes de la historia del país, deja la Casa Blanca por la puerta trasera de la historia. Es el fin de su repugnante reality show y ojalá sea el principio de su entrada en el olvido.
Sin embargo, la sombra que proyectó sobre la democracia de Estados Unidos es una señal de alerta para países con instituciones más endebles y congresos más obsecuentes, como los de Brasil, México o El Salvador, donde la fórmula del populismo nacionalista mantiene atractivo y tracción: mientras la democracia continúa resquebrajándose, las mayorías decepcionadas siguen sucumbiendo al hechizo populista y eligiendo líderes que invariablemente prometen “limpiar el pantano”(Trump), acabar con las “cúpulas podridas y corruptas” (Chávez) o “arrancar de raíz al régimen corrupto” y luchar “por una verdadera democracia” a través de la Cuarta Transformación (AMLO). Y ellos no son los únicos, por supuesto. No hay en América Latina escasez de aspirantes a caudillos.
La agenda de una nueva era de multilateralismo abarca temas específicos de la relación comercial y política de Estados Unidos con los países latinoamericanos. Pero la piedra angular debería ser mejorar las perspectivas democráticas en la región.
Para promover la democracia al sur del río Bravo, Biden debe primero predicar con el ejemplo restableciendo una democracia funcional en casa. Apartando el urgente fortalecimiento institucional, un paso significativo sería ayudar a subsanar las inmensas brechas sociales y raciales de Estados Unidos fomentando una verdadera igualdad de oportunidades.
Biden ha ofrecido una reforma migratoria para legalizar a los millones de migrantes —entre ellos una mayoría de latinoamericanos—, muchos de ellos que trabajan en algunos de los oficios más demandantes y esenciales de la economía estadounidense, una cuantiosa ayuda económica a los países del Triángulo Norte para evitar que los más vulnerables tengan que migrar de sus países y el Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS, por su sigla en inglés) para los venezolanos que han llegado huyendo de la dictadura de Nicolás Maduro. También ha ofrecido promover una amplia colaboración en cambio climático.
Todas estas medidas ayudarán a una mejor relación con la región. Pero recuperar el brillo de la más antigua y mayor democracia del continente facilitará enormemente que la elección entre populismo nacionalista y democracia sea también para los latinoamericanos producto de la razón y no de la desesperación y el fanatismo.

The Trump Administration Officials Who Resigned Over Capitol Violence
Several officials announced that they were stepping down after a mob of the president’s supporters disrupted the process of certifying the election results on Wednesday.
[Follow our live news coverage on the protests at the Capitol and across the country.]
Several Trump administration officials have announced that they are resigning after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, temporarily disrupting Congress as it was certifying Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Electoral College victory.
The officials included those in prominent positions in the White House, and staff members who have been working in the Trump administration since the beginning of the president’s term, in 2017. Some of the resignations came hours after President Trump openly encouraged his supporters to go to the Capitol to protest what he has falsely claimed was a stolen election. The moves are being made with less than two weeks remaining in Mr. Trump’s term.
Here is a list of the administration officials who have resigned.
Education secretary
Betsy DeVos
Ms. DeVos, the education secretary, submitted a letter of resignation to President Trump on Thursday, saying she would step down on Friday.
In the letter, Ms. DeVos called the mob that disrupted Congress as it was certifying the election results on Wednesday “unconscionable for our country.”
“There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” she wrote.
With her letter, Ms. DeVos became the second cabinet member to announce plans to resign after violent protesters overwhelmed the police and stormed through the Capitol.
A billionaire Republican donor, Ms. DeVos was confirmed as education secretary in February 2017 with a tiebreaking vote in the Senate from Vice President Mike Pence.
Transportation secretary
Elaine Chao
Ms. Chao, the transportation secretary, announced her resignation on Twitter on Thursday, becoming the first cabinet member to do so. The unrest at the Capitol, she wrote, “deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.” Ms. Chao, who is married to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said that her resignation would take effect on Monday.
Special envoy to Northern Ireland and former White House chief of staff
Mick Mulvaney
Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s former acting chief of staff, resigned as special envoy to Northern Ireland on Wednesday night, saying he “can’t stay” after watching the president encourage the mob that overtook the Capitol complex.
In an interview with CNBC Thursday morning, Mr. Mulvaney said he had called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday night and told him: “I can’t do it. I can’t stay.”
Mr. Mulvaney praised administration officials who had defended Mr. Pence, who oversaw the tallying of the votes that certified Mr. Biden’s victory despite pressure from Mr. Trump. Mr. Mulvaney said he anticipated that there would be more resignations. “Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they’re worried the president might put someone worse in,” he said.
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney, who was named acting chief of staff in 2018, wrote on Twitter: “The President’s tweet is not enough. He can stop this now and needs to do exactly that. Tell these folks to go home.”
deputy national security adviser
Matthew Pottinger
Mr. Pottinger has been Mr. Trump’s deputy national security adviser since 2019. He was formerly the administration’s Asia director on the National Security Council, and was known for his on-the-ground experience in China, where he advised Mr. Trump during his meeting with President Xi Jinping in 2017. Mr. Pottinger has resigned, a person familiar with the events said on Thursday.
deputy assistant secretary at the Commerce Department
John Costello
Mr. Costello, one of the country’s most senior cybersecurity officials, resigned on Wednesday, telling associates that the violence on Capitol Hill was his “breaking point” and, he hoped, “a wake-up call.”
White House Council of Economic Advisers acting chairman
Tyler Goodspeed
Mr. Goodspeed, the acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, resigned on Thursday, citing Mr. Trump’s incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol. “The events of yesterday made my position no longer tenable,” he said in an interview, after informing the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, of his decision.
First lady’s chief of staff
Stephanie Grisham
Ms. Grisham, the former White House press secretary who served as chief of staff to Melania Trump, the first lady, submitted her resignation on Wednesday after the violence at the Capitol. She had worked for the Trumps since the 2016 campaign and was one of their longest-serving aides.
social secretary
Rickie Niceta
Melania Trump chose Ms. Niceta, a former Washington event planner who helped coordinate Mr. Trump’s inaugural celebrations, as her social secretary in 2017. Ms. Niceta has said she was resigning, according to an administration official familiar with her plans who was not authorized to speak publicly.
deputy White House press secretary
Sarah Matthews
Ms. Matthews, a deputy White House press secretary, submitted her resignation on Wednesday, saying in a statement that she was “deeply disturbed by what I saw today.”
Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services
Elinore F. McCance-Katz
Dr. McCance-Katz, who served as assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse, announced her resignation on Thursday, citing the “violent takeover of the Capitol building.”
“I believe that this behavior was totally unacceptable and, in my own heart, I simply am not able to continue,” she said in a statement. “I believe that we are given certain life situations where we must make the difficult decisions and we get one chance to do it the right way.”
assistant attorney general
Eric S. Dreiband
Mr. Dreiband, who led the Justice Department’s civil rights division since 2018, announced he would resign effective Friday in a lengthy statement calling out “illegal bigotry” and “hate-motivated violence.”
“Our Constitution and civil rights laws embody the ideals that all persons have worth, and are entitled to equal justice, respect, decency, peace and safety,” Mr. Dreiband said. “It is the duty of government to secure these rights, and it is the duty of the civil rights division to protect all people in this nation against any violation of these rights, including hate-motivated violence, exploitation, unlawful discrimination and bigotry.”
Additional national security officials
On Friday, officials confirmed that five National Security Council officials had resigned over the past few days.
The officials were Rob Greenway, senior director for Middle Eastern and North African affairs; Anthony Ruggiero, senior director for weapons of mass destruction and biodefense; Ryan Tully, senior director for European and Russian affairs; Mark Vandroff, senior director for defense policy; and Erin Walsh, senior director for African affairs.

Inside a Deadly Siege: How a String of Failures Led to a Dark Day at the Capitol
Poor planning among a constellation of government agencies and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the unthinkable.
[Follow our live news coverage on the protests at the Capitol and across the country.]
WASHINGTON — Huddled in a command center on Wednesday afternoon, Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington and her aides saw a photograph of blood stains on the temporary grandstands at the Capitol, a makeshift structure built for the inauguration of a new president in two weeks.
The enormity of the deadly failure sank in.
Rioters had broken through the thin police line on the Capitol steps and were descending on hundreds of lawmakers conducting the ceremonial, quadrennial act of certifying the presidential vote — and the mayor and her aides were not able to stop the attack.
Ms. Bowser and her police chief called the Pentagon, asking for additional D.C. National Guard troops to be mobilized to support what officials were realizing was inadequate protection at the Capitol. But they were told that the request would first have to come from the Capitol Police.
In a call to Chief Steven Sund of the Capitol Police, they learned that his force was under siege, lawmakers were being rushed to safety, and rioters were overrunning anyone in authority. He kept repeating the same phrase: “The situation is dire.”
Cutting through the cross talk, one person on the call posed a blunt question: “Chief Sund, are you requesting National Guard troops on the grounds of the Capitol?”
There was a pause.
“Yes,” Chief Sund replied, “I am.”
Yet the Capitol Police and the city’s Metropolitan Police had rebuffed offers days before for more help from the National Guard beyond a relatively modest contingent to provide traffic control, so no additional troops had been placed on standby. It took just over four hours for them to arrive.
It was just one failure in a dizzying list that day — and during the weeks leading up to it — that resulted in the first occupation of the United States Capitol since British troops set the building ablaze during the War of 1812. But the death and destruction this time was caused by Americans, rallying behind the inflammatory language of an American president, who refused to accept the will of more than 81 million other Americans who had voted him out of office.
President Trump’s call at a rally that day for the crowd to march on the nearby Capitol was surely a spark that helped ignite the deadly riots that left five dead — including a policeman and a woman who stormed the building — injured dozens of others and damaged the country’s reputation for carrying out peaceful transfers of power. But the tinder for the blaze had been gathering for months, with every tweet that the election had been stolen, every refusal by Republican lawmakers to recognize Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the next president, every dog-whistle call that emboldened white supremacist groups to violently strike.
A full reckoning will take months or even years, and many lawmakers have called for a formal commission to investigate.
But an initial anatomy of the siege by The New York Times revealed numerous failures. The chaos showed that government agencies have no coordinated plan to defend against an attack on the Capitol — especially one specifically aimed at powerful elected officials — though law enforcement agencies have for years raised alarms about the growing threat of domestic terrorism. QAnon, an online conspiracy group that was well represented among the crowd, has been labeled a domestic terrorist threat by the F.B.I.
Federal agencies and the Capitol Police appeared to issue no serious warnings in the days leading up to the riots that the gathering could turn violent, despite countless posts on right-wing social media sites pledging confrontation and even bloodshed.
The Department of Homeland Security invited local law enforcement agencies to its situation room — held online during the pandemic — only the day before the riots, which some security experts said was far too late.
Poor planning and communication among a constellation of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies hamstrung the response to the rioting. Once the Capitol building was breached, a patchwork group of reinforcements was forced to try to navigate a labyrinthine complex of unfamiliar passages and byways that would prove dangerous.
Above all, the fiasco demonstrated that government agencies were not prepared for a threat that, until recently, seemed unimaginable: when the person inciting the violence is the president of the United States.
The Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Bowser’s chief of staff, John Falcicchio, said that defense officials determined the number of personnel deployed. But Pentagon officials said they made those decisions based on the specific requests they received.
The recriminations began almost immediately, and the violence also carried a sobering reality: The country got lucky. Hundreds of rioters carrying weapons breached the seat of American power — some with the clear intent of injuring, holding hostage or even killing federal officials to stop them from certifying the vote. In the end, all of the lawmakers were spirited away to safety.
“It was such an embarrassingly bad failure and immediately became an infamous moment in American history,” said R.P. Eddy, a former American counterterrorism official and diplomat who now runs a private intelligence firm. “But it could have been so much worse.”
Missed Warnings
“The Capitol is our goal. Everything else is a distraction,” announced one post on far-right social media a day before the uprising. “Every corrupt member of Congress locked in one room and surrounded by real Americans is an opportunity that will never present itself again.”
That was just one example of how extremists were organizing on social media.
In private Facebook groups, activists planning to make the trip to the capital discussed not only logistics like hotels and rideshares, but also sleeping in cars and pitching tents should they need to “occupy” the city. Many comments included photographs of guns and ammunition that they planned to bring.
On smaller social media platforms such as Parler and Gab that became rallying places for the far right, calls for violence were more overt. Dozens of posts in the days leading up to Wednesday listed assault rifles and other weapons that people claimed they were bringing to Washington. People discussed which types of ammunition were best and whether medics would be in place for those potentially injured.
Law enforcement and other officials were aware of the chatter and took some steps to try to reduce the chances of violence. Homeland security officials put tactical agents on standby in downtown Washington. The F.B.I. questioned neo-Nazis who were under investigation and planning to attend the demonstrations, prompting some of them to change their plans and skip the trip, officials said.
And on Monday, the Metropolitan Police Department arrested Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, a far-right group. The police also announced before the rally that anyone who planned to show up to the demonstrations armed, in violation of local firearms laws, would be arrested.
But missed opportunities abounded. Despite the ominous social media posts, officials leading intelligence-sharing centers throughout the United States received no warnings from the federal government about the potential threat to the Capitol.
“We did not see any federal products related to this,” said Mike Sena, the president of the National Fusion Center Association. Such centers were formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to improve communication and planning among federal and local agencies.
One senior federal prosecutor in the Midwest said he did not even speak with the top F.B.I. agent in his city about local residents possibly traveling to Washington. What the F.B.I. had been observing online, officials would later say, amounted to First Amendment-protected activity, despite the incendiary language in social media posts.
Intelligence experts denounced the inability — or refusal — of government analysts to provide proper warning about impending violence.
“The evidence is starkly clear that the momentum of violence has shifted to the right in this country. We’ve seen this in city after city,” Mr. Eddy said. “There was a failure among law enforcement to imagine that people who ‘look like me’ would do this.”
Chase Jennings, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said in the days leading up to the breach at the Capitol, the agency “had open channels with partners and shared information on those channels.”
Protests Last Year
Looming over preparation was the government’s heavy-handed response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations over the summer. Mr. Trump had deployed unidentified agents and tactical teams to the streets of Washington in June against the wishes of Ms. Bowser, and agents tear-gassed protesters, allowing the president to walk to a nearby church and stage a photo op holding a Bible. In the run-up to the violence on Wednesday, the fractured relationship between federal and local law enforcement was evident.
Ms. Bowser had sent a letter to top federal law enforcement officials on Tuesday warning against excessive deployments. Though the city had sought some National Guard troops for traffic control, she noted that the D.C. police had not requested additional personnel from law enforcement agencies for the rallies on Wednesday and referred to the aggressive deployment in June.
Still, federal law enforcement officials conveyed to lawmakers that they were prepared. David L. Bowdich, the F.B.I. deputy director, assured Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the bureau had the resources to handle the Trump rally.
The Justice Department was treating the event as relatively peaceful, officials said. The acting attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, worked on Wednesday from his office rather than the F.B.I. war room, where the crisis response unfolded.
Several officials, including Chief Sund of the Capitol Police, briefed Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, on Tuesday. The message was similar to the one that Chief Sund had given to other lawmakers for days.
“I was told by the police chief and the sergeant-at-arms that everything is under control and they had provided for every contingency,” Ms. Lofgren said in an interview. “That turned out to be completely false.”
‘An Active, Hostile Situation’
Within minutes of the mob breaching the Capitol complex, rioters were pounding on the doors of the House gallery, where a group of nearly two dozen lawmakers were trapped. The sounds of shattering glass echoed through the chamber.
“I thought we’d either have to make a last stand or fight our way out,” said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq. “It was pretty hairy.”
An outnumbered force of Capitol Police had tried numerous tactics to keep the riot at bay, setting up barricades, using pepper spray and trying to push back against the mob at the building’s doors and windows. All of these measures failed.
Lawmakers had no clear evacuation plan and were forced to improvise.
Mr. Crow said he moved other lawmakers away from the barricaded door inside the gallery, helped them don hoods to protect against tear gas, had them remove their House lapel pins to avoid being targeted and took out his only possible weapon: a pen.
After nearly 30 minutes, he said, the Capitol Police and unidentified SWAT team officers cleared a path outside the gallery, above the House floor, and hustled out the lawmakers.
With the police in the lead, guns drawn, the group stumbled through the mayhem, Mr. Crow said. Some police officers rushed to barricade other doors to block the mob. Others pinned some rioters to the ground to allow the lawmakers to pass.
Because of efforts to restrict the number of people in the chamber, several lawmakers and aides were sheltering in their offices, scattered across the complex. Some were not contacted by the police, even as they barricaded themselves inside.
Many of the House members remained in one secure location, where they might have been exposed to someone with the coronavirus, the Office of the Attending Physician said on Sunday.
Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, pushed a handful of Republicans to wear masks, to no avail. Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, and Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, periodically provided updates to the room, as lawmakers called their families and checked on their staff members.
On the Senate side of the Capitol, the rioters came perilously close to lawmakers. As they approached, a quick-thinking Capitol Police officer pushed one of them, then backed away, and the crowd chased him. The officer’s maneuver helped lead the mob away from an entrance to the Senate several feet away, according to a video taken by Igor Bobic, a HuffPost reporter.
In a secure, undisclosed location, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, screamed at the Senate sergeant-at-arms, Michael C. Stenger, demanding a plan and ordering him to clear the rioters, according to a person in the room. Mr. Stenger was milling around, the person said, inspiring no confidence that he was in control of the situation. He has since resigned, as has Chief Sund. Throughout the Capitol, urgent voices crackled across police radios giving details about the unfolding siege.
“There was definitely a higher sense of urgency” on police radio traffic as rioters breached the east side of the Capitol, said Ashan M. Benedict, the head of the Washington field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who was working with the Capitol Police at the nearby Republican Party headquarters, where a pipe bomb was found.
Mr. Benedict connected with a commander of the Capitol Police SWAT team who was inside the complex, who acknowledged that they needed immediate help but said he needed a moment to arrange the official request.
A.T.F. and F.B.I. teams were soon headed to the Capitol. Neither bureau trains its agents for crowd control or riots, and they would have to find a way in, where they could help clear the Capitol and rescue staff members and employees.
When Mr. Benedict and his deputy finally got into the building, it was madness, he recalled. Clouds of noxious gas — bear spray, he guessed, from rioters — floated through the halls. With the help of a Capitol Police officer, they helped usher their teams through a growing crowd of rioters on the building’s south side.
“We walked into an active, hostile situation,” Mr. Benedict said. “Some were thanking us for our service. And some were asking us not to go in and protect the Capitol, and stand with them.”
Chaos and Confusion
Thirty-three miles away, in Annapolis, Md., Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, was on a video conference call with the Japanese ambassador when his chief of staff rushed into his office, telling him, “The Capitol is under attack.”
The governor’s phone rang minutes later: a call from Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader.
“He’s fired up. He’s agitated. He’s stressed,” Mr. Hogan recalled in an interview. “He says, ‘Governor, I’m in a room with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. We need help. What can you do?’”
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
By then, the mob had breached the security outside the building, and Ms. Bowser and her staff members had begun making urgent calls to mobilize larger numbers of D.C. National Guard troops and move those already in the city to the Capitol. In the days before, Ms. Bowser had requested only a relatively small contingent of 340 D.C. National Guard troops, and only to control traffic and help protect public transportation stops, an effort to avoid the militarized federal presence that had been a major factor in the protest response in June.
One of the calls was to Mr. Hogan, asking the governor to dispatch Maryland National Guard troops to the city. Because Washington, D.C., is not a state, the new request needed to be approved by the acting secretary of defense, Christopher C. Miller.
Mr. Hogan’s phone rang. It was Ryan D. McCarthy, the secretary of the Army and the de facto head of the D.C. National Guard. He asked whether Maryland troops could come immediately.
“I said, ‘Yes, we’ve been waiting,’” Mr. Hogan recalled.
Ms. Bowser was having similar problems. Even during the phone call when Chief Sund said he needed National Guard troops to beat back the rioters — a request the mayor and her staff members figured would immediately prompt an order of reinforcements — Pentagon officials would not commit to sending them.
Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, the director of the Army staff, who was on that call, reacted to Chief Sund’s request with caution. He said that he did not have the authority to send the troops, that the request would have to go through his chain of command, and that the group needed a plan for how the National Guard would be deployed.
Chief Robert J. Contee of the Metropolitan Police was livid.
“Are you denying the request?” he asked General Piatt three times.
“We are not denying the request,” the general insisted. But, he added, he would have to seek approval first. The phone call ended.
Inside the mayor’s command center, where officials recalled the debacle in June when the military sent a helicopter to Black Lives Matter protests, frustration turned to anger.
“The Capitol Police were requesting the guard, they were not getting the request fulfilled, and we are seeing blood on the ground of the United States Capitol. That was the moment for me,” said Mr. Falcicchio, the mayor’s chief of staff.
In an interview, General Piatt defended his caution.
“The last thing you want to do is throw forces at it where you have no idea where they’re going, and all of a sudden it gets a lot worse,” he said.
Inside the besieged Capitol, lawmakers were making their own urgent requests to the Pentagon. Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan and a former defense official, called Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to plead for help from the National Guard.
“What I was hearing is that the Pentagon was really struggling with the request,” she said, because of the response to the protests in June, which had brought intense criticism upon the Defense Department and General Milley.
“We all should acknowledge that this was a tough decision” because of the violence last year, Ms. Slotkin said. “I said, ‘Mark, I absolutely understand that you are between a rock and a hard place. But we need help here.’”
Finally, at about 3 p.m., Mr. Miller decided that all available D.C. National Guard soldiers — 1,100 troops — would be deployed.
Help Arrives
As the Pentagon deliberated, city officials sent an urgent dispatch to all local police forces asking for help.
Ed Roessler, the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., was driving when his phone rang at 2:27 p.m. A deputy told him that a request for help had just gone out over the police mutual aid radio system used by law enforcement agencies in the Washington region. He was stunned.
“It was surreal,” said Chief Roessler, a 32-year veteran of the department. “To get a request over the police mutual aid radio system — I don’t recall something at this level.”
About 40 Fairfax County officers were quickly deputized by an official from the United States marshals and sent to Washington. At the Capitol, they assembled in a wedge formation and went inside, where they helped push out rioters.
Then they stood guard while officers from other agencies built a larger security perimeter around the Capitol.
Other requests for help went out, and the Capitol Police also sought assistance from the Homeland Security Department, but not until more than an hour after the rioters had surrounded the Capitol and the police had first fired what appeared to be flash-bang grenades.
When the request came at 2:30 p.m., the Secret Service deployed both uniformed and special agents, according to Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, the parent agency of the Secret Service.
Asked if he wondered why the request from the Capitol Police came at 2:30, Mr. Cuccinelli said, “It’s pretty clear they were underprepared, unfortunately.”
Placing Blame
When the rioters breached the Capitol, Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said a quick prayer.
As he and the other senators made their way out of the chamber to the basement, an officer urged them to hurry because the rioters were on their heels.
“‘Move quicker, people,’ the officer said. ‘They’re right behind.’ It was serious,” Mr. Cramer recalled.
Out of immediate danger, senators took roll call. Four were missing, including Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, who uses a wheelchair after sustaining injuries in Iraq. She had barricaded herself in her office.
Inside the secure location, some senators grew increasingly angry at Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri — Republicans who had vowed to fight the election certification unless a commission was established to investigate Mr. Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.
Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a moderate Democrat, said he approached Senators Steve Daines of Montana and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Republicans who had planned to object to the election to send a message.
“‘Steve, c’mon, you don’t want to be part of this,’” Mr. Manchin recalled saying. “I said, ‘James, you’re better than this.’”
Mr. Manchin said the appeals affected them, but Mr. Hawley showed no remorse.
“Josh Hawley started the whole thing, and all who assisted him, they’ve got to be held accountable,” Mr. Manchin said.
When asked to respond, spokespeople for Mr. Hawley said he had quickly condemned the violence and never claimed there was widespread election fraud, making only a narrow argument about mail balloting in Pennsylvania. Mr. Hawley has declined interviews in the aftermath of the riot.
For others, the blame goes far wider.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said she and other senators were investigating what went wrong and focusing on how to keep Mr. Biden’s inauguration safe.
“There clearly needs to be an overhaul of security,” she said, adding that ultimately, the blame fell on the president of the United States.
“He convinced them this was a righteous cause, to be part of an insurrection,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “And they went for it.”

Businesses, institutions and cabinet members are cutting ties with the president as Washington and state capitals are bracing for renewed threats leading up to Inauguration Day.
Follow our live Capitol riot investigation coverage.
Prosecutors are weighing sedition and conspiracy charges and expect to arrest ‘hundreds’ tied to Capitol riot.
The top federal prosecutor in Washington said on Tuesday that more than 70 people tied to the Capitol riot had been charged with crimes and that he expected that number to rise into the hundreds, with prosecutors looking at charging some rioters with sedition and conspiracy.
Michael Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said at a news conference that the federal investigation was unprecedented in its scope, with the entire Capitol grounds being “essentially, a crime scene.” He cautioned that the investigations would take months or longer.
Mr. Sherwin said investigators had identified at least 170 people who they believe committed a wide range of crimes on the Capitol grounds, with prosecutors looking at charges ranging from trespassing to felony murder. At least four people died during the riots — some of medical emergencies — and a fifth, Brian D. Sicknick, a U.S. Capitol Police officer, died the next day from injuries he sustained during the mayhem.
“We’re looking at significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy,” Mr. Sherwin said, adding that he had assembled a team of national security and public corruption prosecutors specifically to pursue sedition charges against people who had committed “the most heinous acts” on the Capitol grounds last week.
Steven D’Antuono, the head of the F.B.I.’s Washington field office, defended the agency at the news conference after reports that F.B.I. officials in Virginia had warned about a threat of violence the day before the riots. The Washington Post had reported that the warning had mentioned people sharing a map of tunnels and an online thread in which people said people should be “ready for war.”
Mr. D’Antuono indicated that the information had quickly been shared with other law enforcement agencies and he said other intelligence had led the authorities to disrupt the travel of several people who had planned to attend the rally. He also noted that Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys group known for brawling at protests, had been arrested shortly after arriving in Washington for the event.
The F.B.I. is working around the clock on the investigation, and the agency has already received 100,000 pieces of digital media, Mr. D’Antuono said. He added that agents would identify and pursue anyone who had committed a crime at the Capitol that day, even if they had left Washington.
“Agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door,” he said.
In addition to pursuing possible charges of seditious conspiracy, which is defined as an effort by two or more people to overthrow the government or use force to hinder its operations, investigators are also prioritizing investigations into attacks against police officers, theft of confidential information from the Capitol and attacks against reporters.
National Guard troops who are flooding into Washington to secure the Capitol for Inauguration Day will be armed, the Army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, has decided, Defense Department officials said Tuesday.
The armed troops will be responsible for security around the Capitol building complex, the officials said.
As up to 15,000 troops continued to arrive in Washington from all over the country, Defense Department officials had been weighing whether to deploy them with arms. Mr. McCarthy has decided that at the very least those around the Capitol building will carry weapons, said the officials, who confirmed the decision on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. McCarthy’s decision came after a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. Ms. Pelosi, according to congressional staff members, demanded that the Pentagon take a more muscular posture after a mob, egged on by President Trump last week, breached the Capitol.
Pentagon officials say they are deeply worried about protests that are planned for the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. next week. About 16 groups — some of them saying they will be armed and most of them made up of hard-line supporters of Mr. Trump — have registered to stage protests in Washington, officials said.
One Defense Department official said law enforcement agencies are planning for a range of outcomes, including a worse-case scenario in which people with firearms try to attack dignitaries, “suicide-type aircraft” try to fly into the capital’s restricted airspace and even remote-controlled drones that could be used to attack the crowd.
While those scenarios are among the more extreme, the officials said they were particularly worried about the possibility of multiple, violent confrontations, including with firearms, simultaneously flaring up around the inaugural dignitaries.
Defense Department officials said that the White House had signed off on the decision to arm some of the National Guard troops coming to Washington to provide security. Pentagon officials have underscored that the National Guard — not active-duty military troops — will be assigned to those duties.

House Republicans on Tuesday were infuriated by a new rule put in place by the chamber’s top security official requiring all lawmakers to go through a metal detector before entering the chamber.
The rule, announced on Tuesday by Timothy P. Blodgett, the acting sergeant-at-arms, came in an apparent response to the siege last week, and after some Democrats expressed concerns that Republican lawmakers would try to bring firearms intended for self-defense onto the floor.
As lawmakers waited to go through the metal detectors on Tuesday and long lines to get into the chamber stacked up, some began to fume. Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois, the top Republican on the Committee on House Administration, called their placement “bullshit,” and complained to Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat, that the detectors were “taking valuable resources completely away from where it needs to be without any consultation.”
Other Republican lawmakers ignored them completely, sweeping past Capitol Police officers and ducking into the chamber. After setting off the metal detector, Representative Lauren Boebert, a freshman Republican from Colorado who owns a restaurant where the waitresses openly carry handguns, refused to allow Capitol Police officers to search her bag.
F.B.I. officials in Virginia wrote a stark warning the day before a mob attacked the Capitol last week, raising alarms about the threat of violence, according to a law enforcement official.
The report was produced Jan. 5 by the F.B.I.’s Norfolk office in southern Virginia and sent to the bureau’s Washington field office, where it was passed on to other law enforcement agencies, the official said. It was not clear which agencies received it.
The report mentioned people sharing a map of tunnels at the Capitol complex and possible meet-up points in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and South Carolina before traveling to Washington, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on the F.B.I. document.
“Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally or a protest,” the document said, according to The Post. “Go there ready for war. We get our president or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.”
Officials cautioned the information in the Norfolk report was uncorroborated and the portion that quoted “war” appeared to come from a single online thread.
Nonetheless, the report is likely to put the F.B.I. on the defensive with members of Congress and the public demanding answers about why the bureau and other federal agencies were not more prepared for the protests and mob attack, where at least five people died during the violence and in its immediate aftermath.
Supporters of President Trump had descended on Washington to protest Congress’s ceremonial certification of the Electoral College after weeks of his baseless claims of election irregularities.
Last week, Steven D’Antuono, the head of the F.B.I.’s Washington field office, told reporters there was no indication that the day’s events would spiral out of control. He said the F.B.I. saw nothing ahead of time beyond First Amendment-protected activities, which can include protests and even hate speech.
He said the F.B.I. had worked closely with its partners before the Trump supporters, who had come to the Capitol to protest the election results, turned violent.
Since the mob attacked the Capitol, the F.B.I. appears to have taken a more aggressive approach to releasing information to other law enforcement agencies. On Sunday, the F.B.I. warned local law enforcement partners that armed protests were being planned in all 50 state houses and the U.S. Capitol. The warning also included information about an unidentified group calling for others to join them in “storming” state, local and federal courthouses if Mr. Trump was removed as president before Inauguration Day.

House Democrats were briefed Monday night on a handful of specific active threats to the Capitol and to lawmakers in the aftermath of the mob attack on the Capitol.
The briefing by the acting Capitol Police chief and sergeant-at-arms also discussed security steps that were being put in place, as lawmakers pushed for more details on precautions as they returned to Washington for votes on impeachment and a resolution demanding that Vice President Mike Pence wrest the powers of the presidency from President Trump.
Democrats who were on the call said that the presentations detailed the plans of ad hoc militia groups and discussed how determined they were to try to carry them out. At least one plan involved seeking vengeance for the death of Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran from Southern California, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer outside the House chamber last Wednesday.
Lawmakers were left rattled; several confided afterward that they were fearful of re-entering the Capitol this week. Others were also concerned about flying after some were threatened at the airport. Lawmakers pressed the officials on what precautions were being taken to help lawmakers safely travel to and within Washington.
As of Tuesday afternoon, metal detectors had been installed outside the doors to the House chamber, in an apparent response to the siege last week.
In a memo that circulated on Monday, lawmakers were reminded that the purchase of a bulletproof vest was a reimbursable expense, as was security training. Democrats raised the prospect of requiring lawmakers to go through a metal detector on Inauguration Day, citing some Republicans who have pushed to be allowed to carry a concealed gun in Washington despite federal and district law. Given the involvement of several Republicans in various “Stop the Steal” rallies, there is deep mistrust among Democrats toward those colleagues.
One Democrat, who asked to remain anonymous out of security concerns, called the call “the most terrifying hour of my entire life.” But another Democrat on the call, who works on national security issues, said afterward that it was reassuring because it showed that the authorities were properly engaging with the threat, unlike the relative silence and assurances given in the run-up to Jan. 6.
In the Senate, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a letter to his caucus that the attack “showed us we need qualified Senate-confirmed people (not in an acting capacity) in key national security positions on Day One, including Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and others.”
The Senate was expected to hold a security briefing on Tuesday afternoon.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, condemned President Trump’s conduct that led to the siege of the Capitol last week and said on Tuesday that lawmakers who backed his efforts to discredit the election would no longer receive the organization’s financial backing.
The criticism was the latest backlash against Mr. Trump and Republicans from the business community, which has been united in its opposition to an assault on the democratic process, and represented a major rift in the traditional alliance between industry and the Republican Party.
“The president’s conduct last week was absolutely unacceptable and completely inexcusable,” Thomas J. Donohue, the chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce, said. “By his words and actions, he has undermined our democratic institutions and ideals.”
The group said that it is trusting Congress, the vice president and the cabinet to act “judiciously” as it considers whether to invoke the 25th Amendment or impeachment to remove Mr. Trump from office before his term ends next week. The statement did not go as far as one released by the National Association of Manufacturers last week that explicitly called for the removal of the president from office.
The Chamber operates a powerful political action committee that supports candidates across the country. Neil Bradley, the group’s chief policy officer, said that it is evaluating how lawmakers voted last week during the electoral vote certification process and how they vote in the coming days when the House moves to impeach Mr. Trump when making decisions about donations. He said that lawmakers who did not demonstrate respect for democracy would no longer receive financial support.
The relationship between the Chamber and Mr. Trump has at times been fraught. The group opposed his protectionist trade policies and efforts to restrict immigration but supported his moves to cut taxes and roll back regulations.
In a speech on the state of American business on Tuesday, Mr. Donohue called on Mr. Biden to roll back most of those tariffs and work with Congress on immigration reform legislation.
Federal prosecutors filed charges on Tuesday against a suburban Chicago man with a history of making disturbing phone calls to members of Congress, accusing him of making veiled threats last month to commit violence against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. at his inauguration.
The man, Louis Capriotti, 45, was arrested near his home in Chicago Heights on Tuesday morning, according to a statement by John R. Lausch Jr., the U.S. attorney in Chicago. On Dec. 29, Mr. Lausch said, Mr. Capriotti left a voice message for an unnamed member of the House of Representatives from New Jersey, saying that if people “think that Joe Biden is going to put his hand on the Bible and walk” into the “White House on Jan. 20, they’re sadly mistaken.”
Mr. Capriotti also threatened members of the Democratic Party in the voice message, according to a criminal complaint. The complaint accused Mr. Capriotti of saying that he and others would surround the White House on Inauguration Day and “kill” any Democrats who “step on the lawn.”
In the past few years, prosecutors say, Mr. Capriotti has left several messages for members of Congress that “could be interpreted as hateful and threatening.” Last February, F.B.I. agents visited him at his home, and during an interview he insisted that he had only been joking and “didn’t mean any ill will,” the complaint said.
But the troubling messages continued in November and December, prosecutors said, when Mr. Capriotti called two House members from Michigan and one from Pennsylvania, making “derogatory remarks” about their “race, religion, political affiliation and physical appearance.”
In the first of those messages, on Nov. 18, Mr. Capriotti said that he had killed “terrorists” while serving in the military and would “continue to kill them because that’s what I am trained to do.”
According to the complaint, he added that in the coming weeks, some “big news is about to go down” and that people “are going to be astonished of what’s going to be revealed.”
On Monday, a New Hampshire man was arrested and charged with threatening to hang members of Congress if they did not “get behind Donald Trump.” That man, Ryder Winegar, 33, left threatening voice mail messages at the offices of six members of Congress in December, saying in one message that if the member did not support Mr. Trump, “we’re going to hang you until you die,” according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Hampshire.
In a separate case, federal prosecutors in Washington revealed new details about Lonnie L. Coffman, an Alabama man who was charged last week with bringing 11 homemade Molotov cocktails to the riot at the Capitol on Wednesday.
In a bail letter, prosecutors said that Mr. Coffman, 70, was discovered after the riot with an arsenal of weapons, including an assault rifle, at least two pistols, a crossbow, a stun gun and a bag of “camo smoke” canisters.
He also had handwritten notes mentioning Representative Andre Carson, Democrat of Indiana, whom he described as “one of two Muslims in the House of Reps.” In addition, prosecutors say, Mr. Coffman had what appeared to be contact information for the Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, the conservative radio host Mark Levin and Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican.
A 53-year-old man in the Atlanta suburbs who was among those arrested after the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week killed himself on Saturday, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office.
Christopher S. Georgia, a financial adviser who lived in Alpharetta, Ga., was arrested in Washington last Wednesday and, according to court documents, charged with unlawfully entering “the United States Capitol Grounds” and violating the citywide curfew despite several warnings by a police officer.
He pleaded not guilty to both charges on Thursday afternoon in D.C. Superior Court.
On Saturday morning, he was found dead at his home in Alpharetta, killed by a “gunshot wound to the chest,” according to the medical examiner.
According to records, Mr. Georgia had worked as a financial broker in New York, New Jersey and, most recently, Atlanta.

Michigan’s attorney general said on Tuesday that the State Capitol was still “not safe” even after a commission voted this week to ban people from openly carrying guns inside the building because the decision does not apply to concealed weapons.
Dana Nessel, the Democratic attorney general, said that a recent vote by the Michigan State Capitol Commission to ban open carrying in the Capitol did not include any method by which to check that people entering the building with a concealed weapon were allowed to possess one.
“My job is not to provide state employees & residents or other visitors to our Capitol with a false sense of security, especially given the current state of affairs in Michigan and around the nation,” Ms. Nessel wrote on Twitter. “I repeat — the Michigan Capitol is not safe.”
Her comments came the day after the commission voted unanimously to ban the open carrying of firearms in the Capitol in Lansing. The commission’s members said they did not have the authority to enforce a total ban, which would cost $1 million and require metal detectors and a determination of how it would restrict access to the Capitol. The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ms. Nessel’s comments on Tuesday.
Michigan is an open carry state, but after a protest in April when heavily armed men demanded entry into one of the chambers and loomed in a gallery as elected officials conducted state business, more lawmakers began calling for a ban on guns in the building.
My job is not to provide state employees & residents or other visitors to our Capitol with a false sense of security, especially given the current state of affairs in Michigan and around the nation. — Dana Nessel (@dananessel) January 12, 2021
I repeat-the Michigan Capitol is not safe.
Ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, and in the aftermath of last Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol, Washington-area airports and hotels, as well as airlines that fly into the region, are tightening security.
“Travelers may notice additional law enforcement and canine presence, especially when events such as what we have just seen and the upcoming inauguration justify an increased security posture,” said Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration.
In addition to government agencies, companies in the private sector are also taking steps to curb potential violence.
GoFundMe, the largest fund-raising site in the world, said it took down fund-raisers for travel expenses for individuals involved in potentially violent political events and would continue to ban them. In recent months, the company removed several fund-raisers attempting to challenge the results of the 2020 election, a spokesman said.
“We strongly condemn the violence and attempted insurrection and will continue to remove fund-raisers that attempt to spread misinformation about the election, promote conspiracy theories and contribute to or participate in attacks on U.S. democracy,” said Patrick Mahoney, a spokesman for the company in an email.
Airbnb said on Monday that it is reviewing all Washington-area reservations, and those associated with hate groups will have their reservations canceled and be banned from the platform, as will people identified as being involved in criminal activity at the Capitol.
Airlines are also taking measures. Before the riots, United Airlines moved its crews from downtown Washington hotels and increased staffing at area airports. American Airlines is banning alcohol in first class for flights out of Washington (the airline stopped serving alcohol in main cabin last year because of the pandemic).
Representative Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and the chair of the Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement on Thursday that the Capitol rioters should be placed on the federal no-fly list.
“I am urging the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use their authorities to add the names of all identified individuals involved in the attack to the federal No-Fly List and keep them off planes,” he said.
Ms. Farbstein of the T.S.A. said the agency will accommodate F.B.I. requests and congressional authorizations related to no-fly lists.
The son of a Brooklyn judge was arrested Tuesday morning over his participation in last week’s violent riot at the U.S. Capitol.
The man, Aaron Mostofsky, was taken into custody at his brother’s home in Brooklyn, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
Videos and photos from inside the Capitol have shown Mr. Mostofsky wearing fur pelts and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest while holding a protective shield belonging to the Capitol Police.
He faces four federal charges, including illegal entry into a restricted area, disorderly conduct and theft of government property.
Mr. Mostofsky is among the dozens of people who have been investigated by federal and local authorities in the days since a mob of President Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol.
The Justice Department and the F.B.I. are pursuing more than 150 suspects for prosecution, sifting through tens of thousands of tips after asking for the public’s help in identifying those who forced their way into the building.
Mr. Mostofsky’s father is a State Supreme Court judge in Brooklyn, Shlomo Mostofsky.

In his first public appearance since the Capitol siege, Trump expresses no contrition for inciting the mob.
President Trump on Tuesday showed no contrition or regret for instigating the mob that stormed the Capitol and threatened the lives of members of Congress and his vice president, saying that his remarks to a rally beforehand were “totally appropriate” and that the effort by Congress to impeach and convict him was “causing tremendous anger.”
Answering questions from reporters for the first time since the violence at the Capitol on Wednesday, Mr. Trump sidestepped questions about his culpability in the deadly riot that shook the nation’s long tradition of peaceful transfers of power.
“People thought what I said was totally appropriate,” Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, en route to Alamo, Texas, where he was set to visit the wall along the Mexican border. Instead, Mr. Trump claimed that protests against racial injustice over the summer were “a real problem.”
“If you look at what other people have said, politicians at a high level about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places, that was a real problem,” he said.
Mr. Trump’s defiance came despite near universal condemnation of his role in stoking the assault on the Capitol, including from within his own administration and some of his closest allies on Capitol Hill.
How a Presidential Rally Turned Into a Capitol Rampage
We analyzed the alternating perspectives of President Trump at the podium, the lawmakers inside the Capitol and a growing mob’s destruction and violence.
Earlier, he asserted that it was the impeachment charge, not the violence and ransacking of the Capitol, that was “causing tremendous anger.”
Mr. Trump had been largely silent since Friday, when Twitter permanently suspended his account. When asked directly on Tuesday morning if he would resign with just nine days left in office, Mr. Trump said, “I want no violence.”
He did not address his own role in inciting the mob of his supporters. Instead, Mr. Trump framed himself as a victim, calling impeachment a “continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.”
“I think it’s causing tremendous anger,” he said.
The aim of the trip to the border with Mexico is to promote the partially built border wall, which the Trump administration views as an accomplishment. He visited a portion of the border wall in nearby Alamo, along the Rio Grande, where he gave a brief speech before heading back to Washington.
“The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me,” he said. “But it will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for.”
Reading from a script, Mr. Trump briefly addressed the mob attack on the Capitol, noting “we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down. We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting.”
Across the street from the McAllen airport, pedestrian fences were placed where the president’s motorcade was expected to travel. Vehicles from the McAllen Police Department and the U.S. Border Patrol, as well as unidentified unmarked vehicles, patrolled the area ahead of Mr. Trump’s arrival.
At the Aztek Barber Shop in Alamo, Alejandro Silva, 27, said he held nothing against Mr. Trump and did not have an opinion about the border wall.
“But he shouldn’t be visiting now,” said Mr. Silva, a mechanic. “He should leave office and leave everyone alone.”
The president’s supporters were planning two parades on Tuesday in Harlingen and McAllen, but a coalition of anti-border wall activists, led by La Unión del Pueblo Entero, circulated a petition to urge politicians to cancel Mr. Trump’s trip to Alamo.
“We cannot allow Trump to bring his racist mob to the Rio Grande Valley,” said John-Michael Torres, a spokesman for the organizers.
In response to fears, Mayor Jim Darling of McAllen said in a statement: “I understand that emotions are high on both sides, for or against the President and I hope that if there are demonstrations for or against, that they are peaceful with respect to our law enforcement personnel.”
William Webster, a former C.I.A. and F.B.I. director, says he supports impeaching or censuring Trump.
William Webster, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that he supported impeaching or censuring President Trump for “despicable, narcissistic behavior” that “threatened the very survival of our democracy.”
Mr. Webster, a lifelong Republican and the only person to lead both the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., said that a “strong American line in the sand must be drawn” for Mr. Trump’s actions in inciting a violent mob of his supporters to storm the Capitol, where rioters ransacked the seat of American government and killed a Capitol Police officer.
“This latest insurrection demands that our country, through its elected officials, strongly and unmistakably declare that the man who has offered no apologies and still doesn’t think he did anything wrong must be censured, at the very least,” Mr. Webster wrote in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Mr. Webster was among a group of more than 70 Republican former national security officials who had endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president in August, and had often criticized Mr. Trump for his attacks against American intelligence agencies.
Other prominent Republicans — among them former top national security officials — have excoriated Mr. Trump for his role in inciting the riots. Colin Powell, a former secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration and retired four-star general, went as far as to say on Sunday he no longer considers himself a member of the Republican Party.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, called on Tuesday for federal law enforcement officials to add the people who participated in the violent riot at the Capitol last week to the Transportation Security Administration’s no-fly list.
“The folks, the people, the insurrectionists who breached the U.S. Capitol fall under the definition of threats to the homeland and should be immediately added to the T.S.A. no-fly list,” Mr. Schumer said at a news conference in New York City.
The comments by Mr. Schumer, who is poised to become the Senate’s majority leader, come amid growing concerns over the security of the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20.
Experts have warned of threats by some far-right extremist groups, which are already discussing an assault similar to the one on the Capitol. There have also been calls for similar marches at state capitols, with the F.B.I. warning local law enforcement agencies about potential armed protests in all 50 states.
Mr. Schumer is not the only lawmaker to call for the Capitol rioters to be placed on the no-fly list. Last week, Representative Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi who is the chair of the House’s Committee on Homeland Security, also said in a statement that all those identified as being involved in the mob should not be allowed on planes.
“Alleged perpetrators of a domestic terrorist attack who have been identified by the F.B.I. should be held accountable,” Mr. Thompson said.
Carter Langston, a spokesman for the T.S.A., said in a statement that the no-fly list is pulled from a segment of a database of known or potential terrorists that is maintained by the F.B.I.’s Terrorist Screening Center.
The F.B.I. declined to comment on whether it or other agencies had placed any of those identified or charged in connection with the Capitol riot on a no-fly list.

Senator Ted Cruz’s communications director, Lauren Blair Bianchi, has resigned in response to Mr. Cruz’s efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election.
Mr. Cruz’s office confirmed Ms. Bianchi’s resignation, which was first reported by Punchbowl News.
“Senator Cruz and Lauren agreed that it would be best to part ways,” the office said in a statement. “He thanks her for her service and wishes her the best.”
A person familiar with Ms. Bianchi’s decision said she had made it because of Mr. Cruz’s actions last week, when he and Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri formally challenged President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania, promoting false claims of election fraud even as a pro-Trump mob motivated by those claims stormed the Capitol.
Ms. Bianchi, who did not respond to an email seeking comment on Tuesday, “was unhappy with the direction the office had taken,” the person familiar with her decision said.
The events of last week sent a shudder through Mr. Cruz’s and Mr. Hawley’s offices, with many staff members, especially junior aides, discussing whether their bosses’ behavior should compel them to quit, according to several aides close to both offices.
So far, Mr. Hawley, who has sought to reassure his aides, has not suffered any defections. The atmosphere is more tense in the office of Mr. Cruz, who is known to cycle through staffers even during calmer times.
At least one prominent former supporter of Mr. Cruz — the chairman of his 2016 presidential campaign, Chad Sweet — has also broken with him since the attack on the Capitol, and he and Mr. Hawley have become increasingly isolated even within the Senate Republican caucus.
“Donald Trump and those who aided and abetted him in his relentless undermining of our democracy — including Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz — must be denounced,” Mr. Sweet wrote in a statement on Friday. “In particular, I made it clear to Senator Cruz, whom I have known for years, before the joint session of Congress, that if he proceeded to object to the electoral count of the legitimate slates of delegates certified by the states, I could no longer support him.”
In the House, a senior Republican aide on the Armed Services Committee also resigned, calling out lawmakers on the panel who had voted to overturn the election on Wednesday hours after the rioters stormed the Capitol.
“Anyone who watched those horrible hours unfold should have been galvanized to rebuke these insurrectionists in the strongest terms,” the aide, Jason Schmid, wrote in a searing resignation letter. “Instead, some members whom I believed to be leaders in the defense of the nation chose to put political theater ahead of the defense of the Constitution and the Republic.”
He called the Republicans who objected to the election results “congressional enablers of this mob” who had “made future foreign conflict more likely, not less.” The letter, sent to committee staff members and obtained by The New York Times, was first reported by Politico.
Mr. Schmid reported to Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee, who voted to reject the election results. He had also worked closely with Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, a rising Republican star who also voted to overturn the results and was removed on Tuesday from a Harvard political advisory committee.
Politicians continue to face backlash from universities, including their own, after the Capitol riot.
A move by two colleges to rescind honorary degrees they had previously awarded to President Trump has emboldened students and professors at other universities seeking to distance their institutions from political figures who played a role in last week’s events at the Capitol, including Rudolph Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, and Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, who led efforts to deny certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the Electoral College.
Lehigh University in Pennsylvania last week revoked the honorary degree it had awarded to Mr. Trump in 1988, as did Wagner College on Staten Island, which had given one to Mr. Trump in 2004.
On Tuesday, Harvard’s Institute of Politics removed Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican of New York who voted to overturn the election results, from its senior advisory committee. In a letter to other committee members, Douglas Elmendorf, the Harvard Kennedy School’s dean, cited Ms. Stefanik’s “public assertions about voter fraud” and “incorrect” statements she had made about lawsuits seeking to overturn results in key states.
Ms. Stefanik, a close ally of Mr. Trump who graduated from Harvard in 2006, criticized the move, saying in a statement that she was honored to “join the long line of leaders who have been boycotted, protested, and canceled by colleges and universities across America.”
On Tuesday, Middlebury College in Vermont announced that it had decided to revoke the honorary degree that it had awarded in 2005 to Mr. Giuliani. The college cited his role in “fomenting the violent uprising against our nation’s Capitol building,” which the president, Laurie L. Patton, called “an insurrection against democracy itself.” Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, is also facing possible expulsion by the New York State bar association.
Thousands of lawyers and law students, including many associated with Harvard, which Mr. Cruz attended, and Yale, where Mr. Hawley earned his degree, have signed a petition similarly calling for the two Republican senators to be disbarred for “leading the efforts to undermine the peaceful transition of power after a free and fair election.”
The petition, started by Yale law students, said the senators had fomented “insurrection” by a mob that stormed the Capitol last week. It was posted on social media over the weekend and had more than 7,500 signatures by Monday afternoon, including more than 1,800 members of the Missouri, Texas and District of Columbia bars, where the senators are based.
“I think like many people across the country, we were horrified as we watched the Jan. 6 insurrection,” said Daniel Ki, a Yale law student and one of the authors of the petition. “We’ve really just been inspired and heartened by the response.”
Mr. Cruz also faces backlash at Princeton, his undergraduate school, where hundreds of students, alumni and faculty have urged the university’s president, Christopher Eisgruber, to publicly condemn his actions. Mr. Eisgruber wrote on his university blog that “every leader has a responsibility to oppose” the kind of events that happened at the Capitol, but he did not mention Mr. Cruz by name.

A group of former administration officials and anti-Trump Republicans said they would make a $50 million commitment to support the re-election of Republican lawmakers who join Democrats in supporting impeachment of the president.
The financial commitment by the group, the Republican Accountability Project, is designed to incentivize Republicans who have appeared open to voting in favor of the new article of impeachment that is expected to be considered by the House on Wednesday.
“Donald Trump has made it clear he is going to try and politically punish anyone who stands against him,” said Sarah Longwell, a prominent Never Trump Republican who is behind the new group. “His ability to to do that is diminishing by the minute, but we want to provide a counterweight to say there is real money to back people who do the right thing.”
No House Republicans supported the president’s first impeachment in 2019. But as many as a dozen Republicans were said to be considering joining Democrats this time around, including Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican.
If Ms. Cheney “continues to push for accountability,” Ms. Longwell, said, “she’s exactly the kind of person we would want to defend.”
The Republican Accountability Project will be headed up by two former Trump administration officials: Olivia Troye, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence, who served on the coronavirus task force, and Elizabeth Neumann, who served as a deputy chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. During the election, both Ms. Troye and Ms. Neumann became outspoken critics of the administration. The group will operate under the umbrella organization of Defending Democracy Together, an advocacy group aimed at fighting Trumpism within the Republican Party.
Ms. Longwell said the group would even consider backing Mr. Pence in his future political endeavors if he “endorses the idea that the president should resign, be subject to the 25th Amendment, or support impeachment.”
The new group also planned to release a letter signed by over 100 Republicans and former national security officials calling for Mr. Trump’s removal from office. The list included Michael Hayden, a retired Air Force general who directed both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush; and two former acting attorneys general: Peter D. Keisler and Stuart M. Gerson.
The deadly breach at the Capitol last week will be a “significant driver of violence” for armed militia groups and racist extremists who are targeting the presidential inauguration next week, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by federal authorities.
The “boogaloo,” a movement that seeks to start a second civil war, and extremists aiming to trigger a race war “may exploit the aftermath of the Capitol breach by conducting attacks to destabilize and force a climactic conflict in the United States,” according to the bulletin issued by the National Counterterrorism Center and the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, which was disseminated widely to law enforcement agencies across the country.
The federal agencies single out the boogaloo movement, saying members are likely to exploit violence at the presidential inauguration in Washington, D.C.
Antigovernment militias and racists extremists “very likely pose the greatest domestic terrorism threats in 2021,” according to the bulletin.
The federal officials wrote that extremist groups have viewed the breach of the Capitol as a success and have been galvanized by the death of Ashli Babbitt, a QAnon follower who was shot by the police as she tried to enter the heavily protected Speaker’s Lobby, just outside the House chamber. The extremists could perceive that death as “an act of martyrdom,” according to the bulletin.
The Capitol breach, as well as conspiracy theories from QAnon, will likely inspire such extremists “to engage in more sporadic, lone-actor or small-cell violence against common” violent extremist “targets, including racial, ethnic, or religious minorities and institutions, law enforcement, and government officials and buildings,” according to the bulletin.
The federal officials also wrote that “the shared false narrative of a ‘stolen’ election,” the false claim perpetuated by President Trump, “may lead some individuals to adopt the belief that there is no political solution to address their grievances and violent action is necessary.”
The Jan. 6 rally in Washington, D.C., and subsequent breach of the Capitol also offered an opportunity for militia members and extremists from different groups to meet, which could increase the extremists’ “willingness, capability, and motivation to attack and undermine a government they view as illegitimate.”"

Notable Arrests After the Riot at the Capitol
Dozens have been charged since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
On Jan. 6, a mob of Trump supporters, encouraged by President Trump himself, converged on the U.S. Capitol, swept past law enforcement and rampaged through the halls of Congress.
More than 70 people have been charged and at least 170 cases have been opened, Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said at a news conference last week. The F.B.I. has received more than 100,000 tips, including photos and videos.
Mr. Sherwin said some defendants had been charged with misdemeanor crimes so they could be quickly arrested, but may face more significant charges, including sedition and conspiracy.
Here are some of the notable arrests.
Thomas Edward Caldwell, Jon Ryan Schaffer, Donovan Crowl and Jessica Watkins
At least four members of the Oath Keepers, a far right-wing militia founded by military and law enforcement veterans, have been charged for their roles in the siege of the Capitol.
Mr. Caldwell, 65, of Clarke County, Va., was accused in a criminal complaint and affidavit of conspiring to commit a federal offense, along with obstruction of an official proceeding, unlawful entry into a restricted building and violent or disorderly conduct.
The documents say Mr. Caldwell, a suspected leader of the group, sent a picture of the riot to someone on Facebook Messenger writing, “Us storming the castle” and “I am such an instigator!” He also wrote to someone: “We need to do this at the local level. Lets storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!”
Mr. Schaffer, 52, of Columbus, Ind., the lead singer for the heavy metal band Iced Earth, faces six charges stemming from the riot, the F.B.I. said.
The charges against Mr. Schaffer, who was wearing a baseball cap that said “Oath Keepers Lifetime Member” and a tactical vest, included engaging in an act of physical violence in a Capitol Building, the authorities said
During the riot, Mr. Schaffer sprayed Capitol Police officers with bear spray, the F.B.I. said. He wore the same blue hooded sweatshirt that he had on during a Nov. 14 march in Washington by members of the militia group, the F.B.I. said.
Prosecutors also said that Mr. Crowl, 50, a former U.S. Marine, and Ms. Watkins, 38, an Army veteran, both members of Oath Keepers from Ohio, turned themselves in on Sunday.
They published photos of themselves on social media wearing combat gear and saying that they had stormed the Capitol. The charges against them include unlawful entry, assault on a federal officer, disorderly conduct, destruction of federal property, obstruction of an official proceeding and obstruction of justice.
Robert Gieswein
Mr. Gieswein, 24, of Woodland Park, Colo., who has connections with the Three Percenters militia group, was arrested and charged in connection with the riot, according to federal documents unsealed this week. He was among the early wave of invaders to breach the building, according to court records, and was photographed wrestling with Capitol Police officers to remove metal barricades and brandishing a baseball bat.
Three Percenters is a militia group that emerged some years ago from the extremist wing of the gun-rights movement.
In a criminal complaint, prosecutors cite a video that shows Mr. Gieswein encouraging other rioters as they smash a window at the Capitol with a wooden board and a plastic shield, and then climbing through the broken glass into the building.
Riley June Williams
Ms. Williams, a Pennsylvania woman accused by federal law enforcement of taking a laptop from the office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the assault, turned herself in to the local police on Monday.
Ms. Williams, 22, was seen on video taking “a laptop computer or hard drive” from the office of Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, according to a complaint filed by the Justice Department on Sunday. The authorities accused her of unlawful entry, disrupting the conduct of government business and disorderly conduct.
A former boyfriend of Ms. Williams contacted the F.B.I. to identify her in videos recorded during the attack. According to the court filing, he told the F.B.I. that she had intended to sell the laptop to a friend in Russia, who hoped to sell it to Russia’s foreign intelligence service. He also told the F.B.I. that the sale had fallen through.
Michael R. Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, has said that the break-in posed a national security risk because rioters had stolen computers, hard drives and files from the offices of lawmakers.
Ms. Williams can also be seen on video directing crowds up a staircase inside the Capitol, yelling, “Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs,” according to the court filing.
Local law enforcement agents in Harrisburg, Pa., told the F.B.I. that Ms. Williams’s father had told them he drove with her to Washington to protest the election results, and that they returned to Pennsylvania together after splitting up during the day.
Her mother told local law enforcement officers that she had since fled, and the police discovered that after the attack she had changed her telephone number and deleted what seemed to be her social media accounts, the F.B.I. said in the court filing.
Jake Angeli
Mr. Angeli, a well-known conspiracy theorist from Arizona whose real name is Jacob Anthony Chansley, was photographed in the Capitol on Jan. 6 and was arrested on Jan. 9. He entered the building shirtless, with his face painted red, white and blue, and wearing a fur headdress with horns. He also carried a spear, about six feet long, with an American flag affixed just below the blade, according to the Justice Department.
He was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
Adam Johnson
Mr. Johnson, 36, of Parrish, Fla., was arrested by U.S. marshals on Jan. 8 after a widely circulated photograph showed him smiling and waving as he hauled off Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern. He wore a Trump knit hat with the number “45” on the front.
Jail booking records from the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office showed Mr. Johnson was taken into custody on a federal warrant. He was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, one count of theft of government property, and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
Richard Barnett
Mr. Barnett, 60, of Gravette, Ark., was photographed sitting with his feet on a desk in Ms. Pelosi’s office.
“I wrote her a nasty note, put my feet up on her desk,” Mr. Barnett said after leaving the Capitol building. He was brandishing an envelope with the speaker’s letterhead that he had taken from Ms. Pelosi’s office. He insisted he had not stolen it — “I put a quarter on her desk.”
He was arrested on Jan. 8 in Bentonville, Ark.
He was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of public money, property, or records.
Kevin Seefried
Mr. Seefried, who carried the Confederate battle flag outside the Senate floor, was arrested on Jan. 14 after he turned himself in to the authorities in Delaware, putting an end to an F.B.I. search.
Mr. Seefried was photographed during the riot casually carrying the flag through the Ohio Clock corridor and past a portrait of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, an abolitionist. It was the first time someone had managed to bring the flag into the building as an act of insurrection, according to historians.
Mr. Seefried and his son Hunter entered the Capitol through a broken window, the Department of Justice said.
The Seefrieds were each charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and depredation of government property.
Eric Gavelek Munchel and Lisa Eisenhart
Mr. Munchel, 30, was photographed in the Senate chamber clad in military-style clothing and holding zip ties. He was taken into custody in Nashville on Sunday, the Justice Department said. One of the officials involved in the case said the authorities had recovered several weapons at the time of his arrest.
He was charged with one count of unlawfully entering a restricted building and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the department said in a statement.
The department also said that photographs of a person who appeared to be Mr. Munchel showed him “carrying plastic restraints, an item in a holster on his right hip, and a cellphone mounted on his chest with the camera facing outward, ostensibly to record events that day.” He was accompanied by his mother, Lisa Eisenhart, who was arrested on Saturday in Tennessee, according to the Justice Department.
She was charged with conspiracy to commit offense, civil disorder, entering a restricted building or grounds without authority, and engaging in disorderly and disruptive conduct.
Larry R. Brock
Mr. Brock was arrested in Texas on Sunday on the same charges as Mr. Munchel after he was identified as one of the people who broke into the Capitol, the Justice Department said. The department said that images of a person who appeared to be Mr. Brock showed him clad in “a green helmet, green tactical vest with patches, black and camo jacket, and beige pants holding a white flex cuff, which is used by law enforcement to restrain and/or detain subjects.”
The New Yorker identified him as a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, a graduate of the Air Force Academy and a combat veteran. A federal prosecutor in Texas said on Thursday that Mr. Brock had intended to “take hostages,” The Associated Press reported.
“He means to kidnap, restrain, perhaps try, perhaps execute members of the U.S. government,” the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Weimer, said.
Brock’s lawyer, Brook Antonio II, said there was no direct evidence of Brock breaking doors or windows to get into the Capitol, or doing anything violent once he was inside, The A.P. reported.
Robert Keith Packer
Mr. Packer, who was photographed wearing a sweatshirt bearing the phrase “Camp Auschwitz” in the Capitol on Jan. 6, was arrested in Newport News, Va., on Wednesday morning, according to two law enforcement officials. Two people — a former acquaintance and a neighbor — said Mr. Packer is a resident of Newport News.
In addition to a reference to the Nazi death camp, his sweatshirt also included the phrase “Work Brings Freedom,” which is a rough translation of, “Arbeit macht frei.” The German words were welded onto an iron arch that stood over one of the gates of the death camp, where more than 1.1 million people were killed during World War II.
Klete Keller
Mr. Keller, an Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer, was captured on video and identified by former teammates and coaches as a member of the mob that overtook the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Mr. Keller, 38, did little to hide his identity, entering the Capitol Rotunda wearing a Team U.S.A. jacket, his face covering pulled down around his neck. He is also 6-foot-6, which an F.B.I. agent noted in a statement of fact made him appear to be “one of the tallest individuals” in a video posted online by a reporter from Townhall, a conservative website.
He was charged with three federal crimes: obstructing law enforcement, knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
Aaron Mostofsky
Mr. Mostofsky, the son of a Brooklyn judge, was arrested on Jan. 12. Photographs taken inside the Capitol appear to show Mr. Mostofsky dressed in fur pelts and a bulletproof police vest, and holding a protective shield that belonged to the Capitol Police.
Mr. Mostofsky’s father is Judge Shlomo Mostofsky of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
Josiah Colt
Mr. Colt, of Meridian, Idaho, was arrested on Tuesday in Idaho, the Justice Department said.
Mr. Colt was photographed hanging from a balcony and landing on the floor of the Senate chamber, according to court records. In a video posted on Facebook, Mr. Colt bragged about entering the Capitol and sitting in Ms. Pelosi’s chair, calling her a traitor. (He was actually in the Senate chamber, in Vice President Mike Pence’s chair.)
He was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
Anthime Joseph Gionet
Mr. Gionet, a far-right personality known online as Baked Alaska, on social media livestreamed himself for about 27 minutes in the mob as well as inside the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat of Oregon.
Mr. Gionet, who once worked at BuzzFeed, was arrested in Houston by the F.B.I. on Saturday. He was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the Department of Justice.
Mr. Gionet, 33, also posted a video that showed Trump supporters taking selfies with officers in the Capitol who calmly asked them to leave. He has been barred from Twitter and YouTube for his content.
William Pepe
Mr. Pepe, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee from Beacon, N.Y., was arrested by F.B.I. agents in the parking lot of a bank in White Plains, N.Y., on Jan. 12, the authorities said.
Mr. Pepe, 31, called in sick to work so he could travel to Washington on Jan. 6. He was suspended without pay last week from his job as a Metro-North Railroad laborer at its Brewster rail yard.
He faces charges of unlawful entry and disorderly conduct for breaching of the Capitol, the Justice Department announced.
The M.T.A. said it was cooperating with federal law enforcement agencies and had lodged internal disciplinary charges against Mr. Pepe, which, following an investigation, may result in termination from his job, for which he is paid around $73,000 a year.
Robert Sanford
Mr. Sanford, a retired firefighter from Chester, Pa., was arrested on Jan. 14 after the authorities identified him as the man who was seen in a video throwing a fire extinguisher that struck a police officer during the riot.
According to court documents, a witness told the F.B.I. that Mr. Sanford went to the Capitol following “the president’s instructions.”
He was charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of official duties and civil disorder, among other crimes.
Peter Francis Stager
Mr. Stager was charged on Jan. 14 with obstructing law enforcement after officials identified him as the person attacking a police officer on the steps of the Capitol in a video posted on Twitter, according to a criminal complaint.
Mr. Stager, of Arkansas, was identified after the F.B.I. received a tip from a confidential source, according to the complaint.
Mr. Stager was in a large group of people on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, and used a flagpole “with a United States flag affixed to it” to “repeatedly strike” the officer who “remained prone” on the steps, according to the complaint.
Christine Priola
Ms. Priola, an employee with the Cleveland public schools, was charged Thursday with entering and committing unlawful activities on the grounds of the Capitol.
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
She was identified through an anonymous tip to the F.B.I. after she was recognized in a photograph posted on Twitter, according to a criminal complaint.
Ms. Priola resigned from her position as an occupational therapist the day after the riot, according to a copy of her resignation letter that was obtained by Cleveland’s Fox 8 News. In it, Ms. Priola espoused a number of conspiracy theories.
Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr.
Mr. Meredith was charged with threatening Ms. Pelosi after he traveled to Washington for the pro-Trump rally on Jan. 6 and sent a text message saying he would put “a bullet in her noggin on Live TV,” the federal authorities said.
Federal agents said he had been staying at a Holiday Inn in Washington and had weapons in his camper-style trailer, including a Glock handgun, a pistol, a Tavor X95 assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
He was charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, possession of an unregistered firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition, according to court records.
Doug Jensen
Mr. Jensen was captured on video pushing far into the Capitol, ignoring the warnings of a law enforcement officer. The F.B.I. arrested him early on Jan. 9.
The video, taken by Igor Bobic of HuffPost, shows the officer backing away as Mr. Jensen approaches him, moving up the stairs and through the halls of the building.
Derrick Evans
Mr. Evans resigned from the West Virginia House of Delegates on Jan. 9 after participating in the storming of the Capitol. He faces two federal charges: knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
Mr. Evans, a Republican who was elected to the West Virginia House in November, filmed himself entering the Capitol. “We’re in!” he said in his video. “We’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!”
Bradley Rukstales
Mr. Rukstales, the former chief executive of an Illinois marketing company, was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the Department of Justice said.
Mr. Rukstales’s company Cogensia, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said in a statement on Jan. 8 that he had been placed on leave. The company’s interim chief executive later told CBS Chicago that Mr. Rukstales had been fired.
Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson
Mr. Fracker and Mr. Robertson, two off-duty police officers from Rocky Mount, Va., were photographed in the Capitol building making an obscene gesture in front of a statue of John Stark, a military leader in the Revolutionary War, prosecutors said. Mr. Fracker is a corporal in the Virginia National Guard, which planned to conduct “an investigation into the matter,” a Guard spokesman said on Friday.
Each man was charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, prosecutors said.
Dominic Pezzola
Mr. Pezzola, 43, of Rochester, N.Y., used a Capitol Police shield to break through a window at the Capitol, the F.B.I. said in court documents.
A witness told law enforcement that members of a group that included Mr. Pezzola said they would kill Vice President Mike Pence if given the chance, according to the court documents.
Mr. Pezzola was charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, destruction of government property and knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority. He was taken into custody on Jan. 15.
Timothy Louis Hale-Cusanelli
Mr. Hale-Cusanelli, an Army reservist who works as a contractor with a “secret” security clearance at the Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey, was charged with joining the siege at the Capitol, officials said.
He was charged with five felonies, including disrupting the orderly conduct of government business, violent entry and disorderly conduct in a capitol building, according to a criminal complaint.
Mr. Hale-Cusanelli was identified by a confidential source who spoke to a special agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, according to the criminal complaint. The confidential source recorded a conversation with Mr. Hale-Cusanelli in which the reservist admitted to participating in the siege and, according to the complaint, “encouraging other members of the mob to ‘advance’ — giving directions via both voice and hand signals.”
The confidential informant also said, according to the complaint, that Mr. Hale-Cusanelli was a self-described white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer who posted videos on YouTube and other forums “proffering extreme political opinions and viewpoints.”
Couy Griffin
Mr. Griffin, a commissioner in District 2 of Otero County, N.M., and the founder of the group Cowboys for Trump, was charged with a single count of entering a restricted area.
During the siege, Mr. Griffin broadcast images on Facebook showing he was at the Capitol, according to court documents. He also gave interviews to reporters defending his actions and spoke at a public meeting in New Mexico vowing to return to Washington with a firearm for the Jan. 20 inauguration.
In an interview with the F.B.I. on Jan. 11, Mr. Griffin said he was “caught up” in the crowd but denied he had entered the Capitol.
Lonnie L. Coffman
Mr. Coffman, 70, of Falkville, Ala., was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a destructive device after federal authorities said they discovered the components of 11 Molotov cocktails in the form of Mason jars filled with ignitable substances, rags and lighters in Mr. Coffman’s pickup truck.
A search of the truck also turned up a handgun, one M4 carbine assault rifle and rifle magazines loaded with ammunition, the authorities said. When Mr. Coffman was searched, officials found two handguns on him.
Jenny Cudd
Ms. Cudd, a former candidate for mayor of Midland, Texas, was charged with violent entry and being in a restricted building or grounds.
The F.B.I. said in court documents that she streamed a live video of herself inside the Capitol. In the video, Ms. Cudd said she had been watching the president speak before she went to the Capitol.
Ms. Cudd, wearing a “Women for Trump 2020” cap, said later in an interview with a television news station that she “would do it again in a heartbeat.”
Mark Leffingwell
Federal prosecutors said Mr. Leffingwell entered the Senate side of the Capitol and, when he was stopped by law enforcement, he struck an officer in the helmet and chest. The Seattle Times identified Mr. Leffingwell as a 51-year-old Seattle man. He was charged with, among other things, assault on a federal law enforcement officer and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, the authorities said.
John E. Sullivan
Mr. Sullivan, a Utah resident, was charged on Thursday with entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds; and interfering with law enforcement.
He was wearing a ballistic vest and gas mask when he entered the Capitol through a broken window, according to an affidavit. He filmed various scenes during the riot, notably the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt in the Capitol.
Jenna Ryan
Ms. Ryan, who on her Twitter bio described herself as a “Dallas REAL ESTATE BROKER Who Flew a Private Jet to DC to March for Trump,” was charged on Friday with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.
A federal affidavit included photos of Ms. Ryan inside and outside the Capitol, flashing the peace sign as she stood next to a window that had been broken by rioters.
“We just stormed the Capital. It was one of the best days of my life,” she later posted on Twitter.
After her arrest, Ms. Ryan told CBS-11 that President Trump should pardon her. “I thought I was following my president,” she said. “I’m facing a prison sentence. I think that I do not deserve that.”
Emily Hernandez
Ms. Hernandez was photographed with part of the wooden name plate torn from the entrance to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office. The F.B.I. said that at least three tipsters, including someone who was described as a high school friend, identified her to the authorities.
Ms. Hernandez, who lives in Sullivan, Mo., was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and stealing government property.
Dr. Simone Gold
Dr. Gold, of Beverly Hills, Calif., was arrested by the F.B.I. after a special agent submitted several photographs obtained through social media that showed her inside the Capitol during the riot. She also confirmed to The Washington Post that she was on Capitol grounds. Dr. Gold was charged with knowingly entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct.
In July, Dr. Gold was part of a widely seen video of doctors who wore white coats and spewed misleading claims about the coronavirus on the steps of the Supreme Court. The deceptive claims included one that hydroxychloroquine was an effective coronavirus treatment. President Trump shared a version of the video and Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took the video down after it had been viewed millions of times.
Joseph Biggs
Mr. Biggs, a leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, was charged in connection with the riot at the Capitol, as prosecutors said he led dozens of the group’s members in an angry march toward — and into — the halls of Congress.
Mr. Biggs, 37, was arrested in Florida only hours before the inauguration of President Biden and was accused of unlawful entry and corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. At least five other members of the group, which sent hundreds of foot soldiers to Washington two weeks ago for a march in support of Mr. Trump, have also faced charges stemming from the Capitol attack.
Patrick E. McCaughey
On Jan. 20, prosecutors charged Mr. McCaughey with trapping a police officer behind a riot shield as a crowd pressed against him. Mr. McCaughey, 23, of Ridgefield, Conn., was accused of pinning a Washington Metropolitan Police officer, Daniel Hodges, against a door of the Capitol. According to a widely seen video of the incident, Officer Hodges cried for help until he was eventually pulled to safety.
Michael Joseph Foy
Federal authorities in Michigan arrested Mr. Foy after they said videos and photographs on social media showed him using a hockey stick to repeatedly hit police officers during the riot — including beating one who had already fallen to the ground. The F.B.I. identified Mr. Foy using postings on his father’s Facebook page. His father wrote that Mr. Foy, 29, “was raised better,” according to a federal affidavit. Other postings about Mr. Foy cited in court papers indicated that he is a former member of the Marine Corps. Mr. Foy was charged with obstruction of a congressional proceeding, unlawful entry into a restricted building and forcibly assaulting a federal officer.

How a Presidential Rally Turned Into a Capitol Rampage
When President Trump railed against the election results from a stage near the White House on Wednesday, his loyalists were already gathering at the Capitol. Soon, they would storm it. We analyzed a crucial two-hour period to reconstruct how a rally gave way to a mob that nearly came face to face with Congress.

The day’s events were captured by protesters and witnesses who live-streamed the action or posted the scenes on social media. The footage shows the simultaneous and alternating perspectives of Mr. Trump at the podium, the lawmakers inside the Capitol and the swelling numbers — and growing violence — of the rioters on the ground.
For weeks, Mr. Trump had urged his supporters to go to Washington to stop the certification of the election results, and several simultaneous rallies were planned for Wednesday.
As the morning arrives, hundreds assemble on the Capitol lawn, more than a mile away from where Trump will soon speak near the White House. Among them are the Proud Boys, a far-right group, identifiable here by their orange hats.
11:50 a.m. East side of Capitol
At the same time, near the White House, Donald Trump Jr. films the president and his inner circle backstage before his father’s speech. In a video uploaded to his Facebook page, they are listening to the song “Gloria” and marveling at the size of the crowd.
11:54 a.m. South of White House
About 15 minutes into his speech, Mr. Trump tells rally attendees to walk to the Capitol. “You have to show strength,” he says.
At this moment, the Capitol grounds are protected by temporary perimeter fences, and there are few officers equipped to defend them.
12:17 p.m. South of White House
Supporters leave the rally in a steady stream before Mr. Trump’s speech ends, and they head toward the Capitol.
12:29 p.m. Constitution Ave.
As they arrive, another crowd of Trump supporters that has already gathered along the west perimeter fence becomes more agitated.
12:49 p.m. West of the Capitol grounds
Around this time, a pipe bomb is reported at the Republican National Committee building, just a block away from the Capitol. Not long after, another device is discovered nearby at the Democratic National Committee headquarters.

At this time, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, begins the proceedings to certify the Electoral College vote at a joint session of Congress, alongside Vice President Mike Pence.
Outside, the chants begin: “Whose house? Our house!”
1:03 p.m. House Chamber
As Mr. Trump’s speech comes to an end, he calls on his supporters to “walk down Pennsylvania Avenue” toward the Capitol. Rioters there continue to violently clash with officers, including reinforcements from the local police department who have arrived on the scene. Both sides spray chemical agents.
1:15 p.m. West side of Capitol
Inside the Capitol, members of Congress seem unaware of the extent of the violence outside. The House and Senate have moved to their separate chambers to debate certifying the vote. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, argues that the Senate should not certify Arizona’s electoral votes.
1:48 p.m. Senate Chamber
A minute later, Chief Steven Sund of the Capitol Police makes the request for immediate assistance from the D.C. National Guard. Outside, rioters tear through scaffolding in front of the Capitol’s northwest steps and make their way closer to the building.
1:50 p.m. West side of Capitol
On the east side of the Capitol, where the police presence is much smaller, another mob is about to reach the doors of the building.

Follow our live coverage of Biden’s presidency.
Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington on Wednesday night issued an order extending the city’s public emergency for 15 days, warning that extremists who support President Trump might continue to wreak havoc in the nation’s capital.
The order empowers officials to reduce the hours of operation for businesses, order people off the street if a curfew is issued, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety.
The directive, which will expire at 3 p.m. on Jan. 21, extends the emergency through the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Jan. 20. It came hours after Ms. Bowser imposed a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. on Wednesday until 6 a.m. on Thursday.
In a statement explaining the extension, Ms. Bowser pointed to the pro-Trump protesters who came to the city “for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction.”
“They have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles, and guns,” Ms. Bowser wrote. “They have breached the security of the Capitol and their destructive and riotous behavior has the potential to spread beyond the Capitol.”
She added that, “President Trump continues to fan rage and violence by contending that the Presidential election was invalid,” and said, “some persons can be expected to continue their violent protests through the inauguration.”

There are still protesters — and even more law enforcement — around the Capitol in Washington tonight, several hours after a curfew was imposed following a pro-Trump mob’s storming of the building.

Rattled but defiant, members of Congress returned to the Capitol on Wednesday night to resume counting the electoral votes from the November election, a process that leaders on both sides of the aisle said would not be derailed by the earlier siege of the building by President Trump’s supporters.
“This temple to democracy was desecrated, its windows smashed, our offices vandalized,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said as the Senate reconvened.
Mr. Schumer, who is poised to become the majority leader after Democrats won both of Tuesday’s runoffs in Georgia, said that January 6, 2021, was a date that would live in infamy, invoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s phrase after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
He called Mr. Trump’s supporters who stormed the building “goons and thugs.”
Moments earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called the rioters “unhinged” and referred to the siege as a “failed insurrection.”
“We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation,” he said.
From the dais of the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol during the breach, thanked law enforcement officers for restoring order and protecting leaders.
“Violence never wins,” Mr. Pence said. “Let’s get back to work.”
Trump rebuffed initial requests to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol. Pence gave the go-ahead.
President Trump initially rebuffed and resisted requests to mobilize the National Guard to quell violent protests at the Capitol, according to a person with knowledge of the events.
In the end, it was Vice President Mike Pence, defense and administration officials said, who approved the order to deploy. It was unclear why Mr. Trump, who is still technically the commander in chief, did not give the order. The mobilization was initiated with the help of Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, among other officials, according to the person with knowledge of the events.
Kash Patel, the chief of staff to Chris Miller, the acting defense secretary, responded: “The acting secretary and the president have spoken multiple times this week about the request for National Guard personnel in D.C. During these conversations, the president conveyed to the acting secretary that he should take any necessary steps to support civilian law enforcement requests in securing the Capitol and federal buildings.”
The Army activated 1,100 troops of the D.C. National Guard, an Army official said Wednesday, and Virginia’s governor dispatched members of the Virginia Guard along with 200 Virginia State Troopers to quell the violence in the nation’s capital.
The troops were sent to the D.C. Armory to be deployed to the Capitol and to other points around Washington.
A prominent business group calls on Pence to start Constitutional process to remove Trump from office.
A lobbying group for the manufacturing industry — an entity once aligned with the Trump administration — urged Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday to utilize powers within the constitution to remove President Trump from office after Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.
In a lengthy statement, the National Association of Manufacturers termed the violent incursion at the Capitol complex as “mob rule” that it said was fueled by Mr. Trump.
The 14,000-member group, which last year honored Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, said that Mr. Trump was not fit for office.
“This is sedition and should be treated as such,” the group said. “The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy.”
The association called on Mr. Pence to use a constitutional mechanism that provides the vice president and a majority of the cabinet — the officials who lead executive agencies — with the ability to declare that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Both the Senate and House would be required to approve such a measure by a two-thirds vote.
“Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy,” the group said.
Most of those calling for Mr. Trump’s removal as president 14 days before he is slated to leave office were Democrats, but there were some exceptions.
Governor Phil Scott, Republican of Vermont, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump should be ousted.
“The fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the president,” he said. “Enough is enough. President Trump should resign or be removed from office by his Cabinet, or by the Congress.”

Twitter on Wednesday took the extraordinary step of locking President Trump’s account, depriving the president of his favorite means of communication after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and swarmed the streets of Washington.
Twitter took the harder line after removing three of Mr. Trump’s tweets, which it said had violated a company policy that forbids using the platform “for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes.”
Facebook later said it had “assessed two policy violations” against Mr. Trump’s page, and said it was blocking him from posting on the platform for 24 hours.
Twitter said it was acting “as a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C.”
“This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets,” the company said on Twitter. “If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.”
The tweets that were removed repeated Mr. Trump’s false claims of election fraud and expressed praise and sympathy for those who had forced their way into the Capitol and disrupted Congress’s certification of the election results. Twitter also removed a video in which Mr. Trump repeated his baseless claim that “the election was stolen” and advised the mob to “go home,” while adding, “We love you.”
Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, condemned President Trump on Wednesday night for the breaching of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, saying that the president bore direct responsibility for the violence that disrupted the counting of electoral votes by Congress.
“What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president of the United States,” Mr. Romney said in a statement. “Those who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.”
Mr. Romney, the lone Republican in the Senate who voted to convict Mr. Trump last year on one of two articles of impeachment, has been the target of verbal attacks by Mr. Trump’s supporters in recent days. Videos showed one of the president’s followers confronting Mr. Romney before a flight at Salt Lake City International Airport earlier this week. He was later heckled by Mr. Trump’s supporters aboard a flight.
In his statement, Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said that the objections to the counting of Electoral College votes for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. was because of “a selfish man’s injured pride.” He said that Mr. Trump had misinformed his supporters and stirred their outburst.
“They will be remembered for their role in this shameful episode in American history,” he said of Mr. Trump’s supporters. “That will be their legacy.”
Former President George W. Bush, the only living Republican former president, also denounced the actions of those who stormed the Capitol. He did not mention Mr. Trump by name.
“It is a sickening and heartbreaking sight,” Mr. Bush said. “This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement.”

Some of the protesters who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday came in costume — dressed like Vikings, pioneers or soldiers in camouflage. Many had faces painted with American flags and others carried elaborate signs.
Lawmakers will resume counting Electoral College votes on Wednesday after a mob of Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said, as she vowed that the attack could not “deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.”
Ms. Pelosi, in a letter to colleagues, said she had reached that decision after consulting with her leadership team and a series of calls with the Pentagon, the Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence. She made no mention of the president.
‘We always knew this responsibility would take us into the night,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. “We also knew that we would be a part of history in a positive way, today, despite ill-founded objections to the Electoral College vote. We now will be part of history, as such a shameful picture of our country was put out to the world, instigated at the highest level.”
In what could be interpreted as an attempt to stoke the flames of a Capitol mob which has begun to disperse, President Trump sent a tweet at around 6 p.m. in which he reiterated the false claim that the election was stolen and encouraged his supporters to “remember this day” going forward.
“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” he tweeted. “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”
Twitter later took down the tweet, saying that it had violated the company’s rules.
Mr. Trump also posted a video in which he repeated his baseless claims of widespread election fraud on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. All three social media sites removed the video.

A woman who was shot inside the Capitol building after it was overrun by a pro-Trump mob has died, Washington D.C. police officials said on Wednesday.
The woman has not been identified and no information has been released about who may have shot her. Chief Robert J. Contee of the Metropolitan Police Department said earlier that she was a “civilian” and that his officers were leading the investigation.
The woman was pronounced dead at a local hospital, Dustin Sternbeck, a spokesman for the police department, said in an email. Mr. Sternbeck said he did not yet know who shot her or have any other details.
A video posted to Twitter earlier on Wednesday appeared to show a shooting in the Capitol.
The woman in the video seemed to climb onto a small ledge next to a doorway inside the building immediately before a single loud bang is heard. The woman, draped in a flag, fell to the ground at the top of a stairwell. A man with a helmet and a military-style rifle stood next to her after she fell, and shouts of “police” could be heard as a man in a suit approached the woman and crouched next to her.
“Where’s she hit?” people yelled as blood streamed around her mouth.
Within minutes of the mob breaching the Capitol complex, rioters were pounding on the doors of the House gallery, where a group of lawmakers were trapped.
“I thought we’d have to fight our way out,” said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq.
Mr. Crow said he moved other members away from the barricaded door inside the gallery, helped them don gas masks, told them to take off the lapel pins assigned to all House members and took out his only possible weapon — a pen.
After 15 minutes, he said, Capitol Police and SWAT team members on a rescue mission hustled the members out by clearing a path outside the gallery, above the House floor.
With police in the lead, guns drawn, the lawmakers entered a scene of chaos and mayhem, Mr. Crow said. Some police rushed to barricade doors to block rioters. Others pinned protesters to the ground to allow the lawmakers to pass.
“We heard yelling through the halls,” said Mr. Crow, who described bringing up the rear to ensure all the members made it to safety. As police led the members down stairwells and into the subterranean maze of tunnels to a secure location, Mr. Crow said he called his wife, who had been watching the terrifying scene on television from Colorado.
Mr. Crow said lawmakers were determined to resume their work in the Capitol on Wednesday night, if possible, once the buildings were cleared of remaining threats. “We want to go back and finish the business of the people to show that we are a democracy, and that the government is stronger than any mob,” he said.
Police seized five guns and arrested at least 13 people during the violent protests involving supporters of President Trump at the Capitol on Wednesday, Chief Robert J. Contee of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department said on Wednesday.
Chief Contee said the firearms included handguns and long guns. He also noted that none of the people arrested were residents of the District of Columbia.
At the same news conference, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the violent protests, where Trump supporters looted and vandalized congressional offices, “shameful” and “unpatriotic.”
And she pledged that “anyone who has engaged in these activities” will be held accountable. “There will be law and order and this behavior will not be tolerated,” she said.

The sergeant-at-arms, who is responsible for Congress’s security, has told lawmakers and reporters that the Capitol is now secure, though lawmakers, staff and reporters continue to shelter in much of the Capitol complex.
Lawmakers in both parties have called for the certification process of the Electoral College votes to resume with the securing of the building. No word yet if and when that will begin.
Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, vowed that Congress would continue the counting on Wednesday night.
“I have faced violent hatred before,” Mr. Clyburn said on Twitter. “I was not deterred then, and I will not be deterred now. Tonight, Congress will continue the business of certifying the Electoral College votes.”
Mr. Clyburn, an instrumental early supporter of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., condemned the breach of the Capitol.
“This authoritarian menace will not succeed in his attempts to overthrow our democratically elected government,” he said, apparently referring to President Trump. “I am praying for the safety and security of the public servants who are dedicated to making this country a ‘more perfect union.’ ”"
54,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/world/europe/reichstag-germany-neonazi-coronavirus.html,"“They shout ‘We are the people,’ but they’re not,” Mr. Quent said of the protesters who swarmed the Reichstag.
“In Germany, like many other European countries, we see that far-right parties are losing ground, that there is growing trust in incumbent governments,” Mr. Quent said. “In the short term the pandemic can’t be exploited by far-right parties.”
If the economy deteriorates further and unemployment rises, that equation may change, he said. Already, the AfD and more extreme far-right groups are trying to capitalize on the discontent as they begin positioning themselves for what may be a much uglier political scene some months from now.
What worries officials and extremism experts more immediately is that even if the far right is a minority at the protests, it is radicalizing. Among those calling on supporters to join the protest on Saturday were Björn Höcke, an AfD firebrand, and Martin Sellner, star of the extremist Generation Identity movement, both of whom have been classified as far-right extremists by the domestic intelligence service.
Message boards are flush with far-right conspiracy theories and prepper groups, which have long fantasized about a crisis so deep that it would lead to the collapse of Germany’s liberal order. Ahead of Saturday’s protest, which the city government had tried to block before being overruled by a court, several public groups on the messaging app Telegram had called for a “storm on Berlin.”
Some had posted photos of themselves and their weapons. “That is very unusual for Germany,” Mr. Quent said.
The authorities are on high alert. Over the past 14 months, far-right terrorists have assassinated a regional politician on his front porch near the central city of Kassel, attacked a synagogue in Halle, in the east, and in February, killed 10 people in the west, in Hanau. Even before the pandemic hit Germany, far-right extremism and far-right terrorism had been officially identified as the biggest danger to the country’s democracy."

WASHINGTON — During the four-and-a-half-hour attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, one of the moments when the mob came closest to the lawmakers they were pursuing took place just after 2:30 p.m.
On one side of a set of antique wood and glass doors were dozens of lawmakers and their aides trying to evacuate the House chamber.
On the other were rioters yelling “Stop the steal” as they hammered the panes with a flagpole, a helmet and even a bare fist.
In between was a Capitol Police lieutenant, scrambling to pile tables and chairs into a makeshift barricade. He had 31 rounds for his service weapon, and he has told others that he feared he might need them all.
At the height of the standoff, a woman named Ashli Babbitt tried to vault through a window. The lieutenant, his weapon already extended, pulled the trigger once, killing her in a confrontation that was captured on video and widely viewed around the world.
At least three investigations into the security response on Jan. 6 are underway, and officials have not provided the full details of Ms. Babbitt’s death.
But videos taken of the episode, legal documents and witness accounts point to a dire set of circumstances and an officer left to confront a mob. The officer, a lieutenant who has not been publicly named, has been placed on administrative leave while his actions are reviewed by federal authorities.
The use of deadly force by officers is considered legally justified if they have an “objectively reasonable” fear of serious, imminent harm to themselves or others. Several policing experts said that video of the encounter was not enough for them to offer an opinion on the shooting. But interviews with two people with direct knowledge of the officer’s account suggest he will make the case that he acted to protect lawmakers from harm.
“I could look them in the eyes,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, who had been presiding in the speaker’s chair and was one of the last to leave as the mob attempted to break through the doors. “I mean, that’s how close they were.”
He added: “I don’t even know what would have happened had they breached that area.”
Ms. Babbitt’s husband, Aaron, told a Fox affiliate on the day of the riot that he had seen his wife die on the news.
“She didn’t have any weapons on her, I don’t know why she had to die in the People’s House,” he said, adding, “She was voicing her opinion and she got killed for it.”
He did not respond to an email requesting comment. One of Ms. Babbitt’s brothers, reached by phone, declined to comment.
Ms. Babbitt was one of five people who lost their lives at the Capitol that day. A Capitol Police officer was overpowered and beaten by rioters. A Georgia woman appeared to have been killed in a crush of fellow rioters. One man had a stroke, and another a heart attack.
The lieutenant had heard on the news that Trump supporters like Ms. Babbitt would be converging on Washington, according to his account. But the first time the protests were discussed at work came only when he arrived early that morning; according to his account, he had been given no advance planning to counter a violent riot or an invasion of the building.
That afternoon both the House and the Senate were in session, with hundreds of lawmakers debating challenges to the certification of the Electoral College vote when the mob fought its way past lines of Capitol Police officers outside and forced their way into the building. Some said they merely wanted to halt the proceedings while others carried weapons, climbing gear and zip ties that could be used as restraints.
The crowd was peppered with far-right nationalists, military veterans and militia members, and adherents of a dangerous conspiracy. Rioters hurled invectives at police officers and called them traitors, threatening to kill former Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The lieutenant, a veteran officer, was regularly assigned to the Speaker’s Lobby, an enclosed hallway and waiting area in the inner sanctum of the Capitol where access is highly restricted. The lobby runs directly behind the House chamber and is lined with portraits of the House’s past leaders. It is bound by two sets of old wooden doors with windows, one on the Democratic side and one on the Republican side.
At about 2:15 p.m., the lieutenant heard on the radio that the Capitol had been breached, according to his account.
Ms. Pelosi was escorted from the chamber, but so little was understood about the situation at that point that she left her phone behind on the dais as if she would return shortly, Mr. McGovern recalled.
At 2:30 p.m., a crowd that included Ms. Babbitt streamed through the Capitol Rotunda and Statuary Hall. At that point, they were calm, even staying within a walkway defined by velvet ropes. But as they surged toward the north doors of the House, they grew aggressive, chanting, “Break it down.”
“Hey guys, I have a knife,” one person in the crowd can be heard saying.
Those doors had been barricaded on the inside with furniture, and three plainclothes officers just inside the chamber had drawn their guns.
On the floor, the proceedings were repeatedly disrupted as leaders were ushered out.
“You could hear people shouting outside the door of the chambers and pounding on the door,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California.
But no one on the House side yet understood the size of the crowd or the gravity of the situation, Mr. McGovern said.
Seeking another way into the House chamber, part of the crowd, including Ms. Babbitt, peeled off and made its way around to the Democratic side of the Speaker’s Lobby.
They were heading right for the passage being used to evacuate the House floor. Dozens of lawmakers and aides, according to witness estimates, were being ushered through doors on the Republican side of the chamber into the Speaker’s Lobby. It was a slow-moving group that had to funnel into a narrow staircase.
When Mr. McGovern reached the corridor, he turned to see the barricade of upturned furniture and the scene beyond.
“I could see the angry crowd banging on the glass, and I saw several police officers sandwiched between the crowd and the doors,” he said. “That’s when I realized that this was more than just a few people.”
He added, “You ask me to describe evil — that’s what it looked like. I mean, these people seem crazed. And I mean, they weren’t here to make a political point. They were here to destroy things.”
Standing guard outside the doors were three Capitol Police officers. The crowd hurled insults at them and punched the glass just inches from their heads. To the right, at the top of a stairwell, stood a man in a suit with an earpiece, identified by a person familiar with congressional security as an unarmed member of the House sergeant-at-arms staff.
Near the front was Ms. Babbitt, 35, who had served 14 years in the Air Force and was an enthusiastic supporter of President Donald J. Trump. Her social media feed was filled with QAnon conspiracy theories.
One man in the crowd, David Charles Mish Jr. of Wisconsin, told an investigator later that Ms. Babbitt was telling the police officers, “Just open the door. They’re not gonna stop,” according to an affidavit.
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
Inside the doors was the lieutenant, who, according to his account, had trained to deal with an active shooter but never a scenario like this, in which the Capitol was being overrun by large numbers of people. Calls for backup and reports of officers engaged punctuated the radio traffic.
Since the breach began, rioters had wielded bear spray, batons, pipes and fire extinguishers against officers. When the lieutenant thought he heard on the radio that shots had been fired, according to his account, he positioned himself in a doorway off to one side of the corridor, with a view of anyone trying to get through the glass doors.
With the lawmakers slowly draining out the far end of the hall, those doors became a strategic choke point.
The officer, according to his account, could not see the three uniformed officers outside and did not know they were there — he only described seeing a hallway full of oncoming people. The three officers had no visible shields or riot gear — two of them were not even wearing hats.
According to the lieutenant’s account, he did not know who among the rioters, if anyone, was armed. Nor could he see how far down the hall the crowd extended.
The lieutenant was also unaware, those briefed on his account said, that a tactical team from the Capitol Police was climbing the stairwell behind Ms. Babbitt, intending to reinforce the area and clear out the rioters.
As the team arrived, one of the three officers standing guard gave the word: “They’re ready to roll.”
The officers moved away from their post, leaving the doors unguarded for a crucial 30 seconds.
“Go! Let’s go!” someone yelled as a few rioters renewed their attack on the glass. They continued to hammer, shaking the doors in their frames.
Several members of the crowd have since been identified and arrested by the F.B.I. They include Christopher Ray Grider, a winery owner from central Texas who is accused of trying to kick in the doors and supplying a black helmet used to break windows, and Chad Barrett Jones of Coxs Creek, Ky., accused of breaking windows with a flagpole.
As they moved in, they got a clear view of the lieutenant on the other side, who was raising his .40-caliber Glock handgun.
“There’s a gun!” “He’s got a gun!” people shouted.
In the thick of the action, a man wielding the helmet broke out the windowpane in front of Ms. Babbitt. A few seconds later, someone tried to boost her through. She wore a Trump flag around her neck like a cape, and a backpack over it.
As Ms. Babbitt was hoisted up, the lieutenant fired a single shot. She plummeted backward, striking the hard floor. There was no evidence that she had been armed.
Since Ms. Babbitt’s death, far-right extremists and white supremacists have claimed her as a martyr and a “freedom fighter,” even reproducing her image on flags and with anti-Semitic imagery. Many have demanded the release of the name of the officer who shot her.
Mr. McGovern said any loss of life was tragic. But he praised the Capitol Police as heroes, noting that no members of Congress or their staff had been harmed. “I think he and others showed a great deal of restraint in this whole thing,” he said of the lieutenant.
The shooting put an end to the attempts to break through the doors. Officers tried to push back the rioters and give Ms. Babbitt medical aid.
A member of the tactical team tried to stop her bleeding, pressing down on her left shoulder as blood streamed from her mouth and nose.
Outside the Capitol, word of the shooting began to spread, helping fuel the mob’s anger.

White House Orders Assessment on Violent Extremism in U.S.
The order for the evaluation from the intelligence community comes as judges continue to deny bail for suspects in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
WASHINGTON — President Biden on Friday ordered the director of national intelligence to work with the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the threat from domestic violent extremism, a sign of how seriously the new administration is taking the issue in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.
The request comes only days after Avril D. Haines, the newly installed director of national intelligence, pledged to members of Congress during her confirmation hearing that she would help with just such an assessment.
The new intelligence work began as people charged in the mob attack on the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald J. Trump continued to appear in court. On Friday, a federal magistrate judge in Dayton, Ohio ordered Donovan Crowl, an accused rioter linked to the far-right group the Oath Keepers, detained until his trial, citing the safety of the community.
Domestic terrorism and violent groups are a thorny issue for intelligence agencies like the C.I.A., which are limited to tracking attempts by foreign governments or organizations to influence extremist groups in America. The F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security have more leeway to investigate domestic groups and homegrown terrorism.
But Friday’s order will have practical as well as symbolic import. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the assessment would help Mr. Biden hone his policies aimed at curbing violent extremism in the United States.
“This assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and, as appropriate, nongovernmental organizations,” Ms. Psaki said. “The key point here is that we want fact-based analysis upon which we can shape policy.”
In recent years, some parts of the intelligence community have been working to increase their focus on the threat of domestic terrorism, particularly by doing more to track growing foreign influence operations on domestic groups. The C.I.A. also has officers in its counterterrorism section who specialize in tracking racially-motivated violent extremists overseas.
During the last two Congressional sessions, lawmakers passed a measure requiring intelligence agencies to work on annual reports and strategic assessments of domestic extremism.
“Far-right, white supremacist extremism, nurtured on online platforms, has become one of the most dangerous threats to our nation,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
The domestic terrorism order is the second assignment in two days for Ms. Haines, who was confirmed by the Senate Wednesday evening. On Thursday, the White House ordered a new intelligence assessment of Russia and its role in a broad hacking of government computers.

- Giuliani concedes that an associate did ask for $20,000 a day to help Trump post-election.
The new order on domestic extremism, and growing interest on Capitol Hill, could also push the intelligence agencies and law enforcement to look for ways to work more closely on tracking and countering extremist groups in the country.
The growing concern about these groups is also reflected in the tough stances judges have taken with those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 riot.
Mr. Crowl, the suspect denied bail in Ohio, was part of a group dressed in paramilitary equipment that approached the Capitol “in an organized and practiced fashion” to move their way to the front of the crowd, according to court papers.
In a New Yorker article about the riot, Mr. Crowl, a 50-year-old Ohio resident, acknowledged that he had entered the Capitol but claimed that he had traveled to Washington to “do security” for “V.I.P.s” whom he did not name and that his intentions had been peaceful. But court filings made clear that prosecutors did not believe that.
“This defendant, through force and violence, attempted to disrupt the process that our country’s been engaged in for over 200 years,” said the prosecutor, Nicholas Dingeldein, during the hearing on Friday. “He’s been preparing for literal war because that’s what this organization, the Oath Keepers, has told him he has to do.”
The judge, Sharon L. Ovington, noted that Mr. Crowl had a criminal record and said she saw “clear and convincing evidence” that there were no conditions that would reasonably assure Mr. Crowl’s appearance in court or the safety of the community.
Citing the weapons that authorities found at the place where Mr. Crowl suggested he would stay if released, she said, “The suggestion that I release him to a residence containing at least nine firearms is a non-starter.”
In Arkansas on Friday, a magistrate judge denied bail to Peter F. Stager of Conway, Ark., ordering that he remain in custody until trial.
Mr. Stager, 41, was taken into custody on Jan. 14 and charged with obstructing law enforcement officers, a felony, after officials identified him as the person seen attacking a police officer on the steps of the Capitol in a widely viewed video, according to the criminal complaint.
Judge J. Thomas Ray said “it was a crime of violence against a helpless victim” of the video that showed Mr. Stager using a flagpole to beat an officer in uniform, who was being held down by others in the crowd.
In a second video, Mr. Stager is heard to say, “Everybody in there is a treasonous traitor,” referring to occupants of the Capitol.
Another accused rioter, Scott Kevin Fairlamb, was arrested on Friday in New Jersey, after various tipsters submitted evidence to law enforcement. In one video, a man later identified as Mr. Fairlamb shoved and punched an officer on the West Front of the Capitol, according to an affidavit from the F.B.I. In a video posted on Mr. Fairlamb’s Facebook page, he could be seen carrying a collapsible baton and saying, “What Patriots do?”
Using two expletives, he then continued: we “disarm them and then we storm” the Capitol.
And in New York, a federal magistrate judge denied bail on Friday for Jeffrey Sabol, a geophysicist from Colorado who was accused of dragging a police officer down the stairs outside the Capitol and allowing another rioter to beat the officer with an American flag.
At his bail hearing, a prosecutor suggested Mr. Sabol had tried to flee the country after the riot; he had purchased a plane ticket to Switzerland, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. Mr. Sabol also tried to take his own life after the riot, the prosecutor said, and spent several days recovering at the hospital.

U.S. Will Give Terrorist Label to White Supremacist Group for First Time
The designation of the Russian Imperial Movement reflects growing concerns among U.S. officials about violent white supremacists with transnational links.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is expected to announce on Monday that it is designating an ultranationalist group based in Russia as a terrorist organization, according to officials. It is the first time the government will apply the label to a white supremacist group.
While the label of specially designated global terrorist has been frequently used for Islamist extremists, there have been growing concerns among U.S. officials about violent white supremacists with transnational links over the past five years. In 2018, the White House added that threat to the government’s National Strategy for Counterterrorism.
“These designations are unprecedented,” said Ambassador Nathan A. Sales, the State Department’s counterterrorism coordinator. “This is the first time the United States has ever designated white supremacists as terrorists, and this illustrates how seriously this administration takes the white supremacist terrorist threat. We are doing things no previous administration has done to counter this threat.”
The State Department’s designation for the organization, the Russian Imperial Movement, sets up the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to block any American property or assets belonging to the group. It will also bar Americans from financial dealings with the organization and make it easier to ban its members from traveling to the United States.
The United States is also designating three of the group’s leaders — Stanislav Anatolyevich Vorobyev, Denis Valliullovich Gariev and Nikolay Nikolayevich Trushchalov — as individual terrorists who will face similar sanctions, the officials said.
The authority for either the Treasury Department or the State Department to deem a group or an individual a specially designated global terrorist traces back to an executive order issued by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. President Trump in September signed an executive order expanding that authority to cover groups that provide training for terrorists even if the groups are not directly linked to any attack.
The system parallels in some ways but is different from when the government designates a group as a foreign terrorist organization, which has separate criteria and applies only to groups rather than individuals.
The move could cut against criticism that the Trump administration has played down the threat of white nationalist violence for political reasons, based on the so-called alt-right’s support for Mr. Trump and his statement in 2017 that there were “very fine people on both sides” of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va.
The Russian Imperial Movement is not considered to be sponsored by the Russian government, officials said, although President Vladimir V. Putin has tolerated its activities and it has helped advance the Russian government’s external goals by recruiting Russian fighters to aid pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The group has also helped support neo-Nazi organizations in Scandinavia, which dovetails with the Russian government’s broader pattern of trying to stoke internal divisions, including along racial lines, and sow chaos in Western democracies.
In 2017, the Russian Imperial Movement came up at a trial in Sweden of three men who were accused of plotting bomb attacks targeting asylum seekers. Prosecutors said two of the defendants had traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia, to attend 11 days of paramilitary training at a camp operated by the group, fueling their radicalization.
Mr. Sales said the group operated two facilities in St. Petersburg that offered paramilitary training to neo-Nazis and white supremacists. He said the United States had assessed that the camps were “likely being used for woodland and urban assault, tactical weapons and hand-to-hand combat training.”
Mary McCord, a former head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said that until now, the counterterrorism sanctions system had overwhelmingly been used against Islamist extremist groups. She called its expansion to a white supremacist group significant.
“It is important,” she said. “Far-right extremist causes, in particular white supremacy and white nationalism, have become more international. It is appropriate for the State Department to have been scrutinizing whether there are organizations that meet the criteria for that designation because with it, the organization becomes poison in terms of doing business with it or providing funds, goods or services to it.”
The move is also another example of the Trump administration expanding its use of the power Congress granted to the executive branch to impose sanctions on groups by designating them foreign terrorist organizations. Last year, under a separate authority, the United States designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, an arm of the Iranian military, as a foreign terrorist group — the first time it gave that label to a nation-state entity.
Concerns have been escalating for several years that there is a growing transnational white supremacist or alt-right movement, as illustrated by the 2019 mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, by an Australian man who streamed the killings of 51 people on Facebook Live.
Against that backdrop, national security officials are said to have been searching for a neo-Nazi-style group that the U.S. government could designate as a foreign terrorist organization.
One challenge to finding an appropriate candidate was that designating a group with significant American ties would also raise major First Amendment issues, officials said. Although a Russian Imperial Movement member has visited the United States, the organization does not appear to have domestic members. It is not clear if the group has provided training to U.S.-based neo-Nazis.
Fighting domestic terrorism, including violent white nationalists, has become a priority for the F.B.I. Federal and local authorities have made a wave of arrests in recent months, targeting members of two neo-Nazi groups called Atomwaffen Division and The Base.
The F.B.I. has been investigating whether the leader of The Base, who lives in St. Petersburg, has any ties to the Russian government’s security or intelligence services, former law enforcement officials said.
Mr. Sales said they were continuing to look for other white supremacist groups or individuals who met the criteria for sanctions, but declined to comment on any specifics.
The designation of the Russian Imperial Movement would make it easier for the F.B.I. to open sanctions-evasion investigations into Americans who appear to have ties to the group, just as it can with Islamist groups like Al Qaeda, the Islamic State or Hezbollah.
The Trump administration is preparing to unveil the move under the banner of combating “racially or ethnically motivated terrorism.” The F.B.I. refers to such groups as racially motivated violent extremists, which have committed the “most lethal incidents among domestic terrorists in recent years,” the F.B.I. said last year in congressional testimony."

The Capitol Police Had One Mission. Now the Force Is in Crisis.
The department’s performance during the rampage at the Capitol has cast a harsh light on an agency that has been unused to public scrutiny.
As old as the Capitol itself, the Capitol Police began in 1801 with the appointment of a single guard to oversee the move of Congress from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. His task, according to a court filing, was to “take as much care as possible with the property of the United States.”
Over the years, the force — whose positions were once filled entirely through patronage — was professionalized and expanded, usually in the aftermath of crises like the shooting of five lawmakers by Puerto Rican nationalists in 1954, the killing by a gunman of two officers inside an entrance to the building in 1998, or the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Today, it is in crisis once again, with calls for a full investigation into what lawmakers have called a “severe systemic failure” that allowed an angry mob of Trump loyalists to storm the Capitol last week, an episode that left five people dead, including one Capitol Police officer.
Three officers have been suspended and 17 more are under investigation, according to a senior congressional aide.
The department is accustomed to being shielded from the type of public disclosure that is routine for ordinary police agencies. But since last week’s rampage, the department’s chief and two other top security officials have resigned, and its congressional overseers have pressed for answers.
On Wednesday, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio complained that the agency was a “black box.”
“We’re having a hell of a time getting information from Capitol Police leadership,” said Mr. Ryan, who chairs the House committee that oversees the department’s budget. “We fund the Capitol Police. Congress funds the Capitol Police through the Appropriations Committee. We deserve to know and understand what the hell is going on.”
Operating under the protective wing of Congress, the Capitol Police has more than 2,000 officers to defend two square miles and a half-billion dollar budget — bigger than those that fund the police departments in Atlanta and Detroit.
But it has long suffered from the same troubles that afflict many other police forces: claims of an old boys’ network, glass ceilings, racial bias and retaliation. There have been complaints, too, of lax discipline and of promotions for white commanders who faced misconduct allegations, but harsh treatment for women and Black officers.
A handful of high-profile incidents in recent years — locking down the Capitol but failing to inform Congress; ordering a nearby tactical team not to respond when a gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard; the fatal shooting of a Black woman who made a U-turn at a White House checkpoint and led officers on a chase toward the Capitol — have raised questions about the department’s procedures and operational paralysis.
Many who are familiar with the department now suggest that these longstanding problems contributed to how easily its officers were overrun last Wednesday.
“Why was I not surprised?” said Sharon Blackmon-Malloy, the lead plaintiff in a racial discrimination lawsuit against the department that has languished for years, while she and a handful of other retired Black officers have staged regular demonstrations on Capitol Hill. “Because I’m going back to the environment in which I worked in all those years.”
While many of the law enforcement agencies that rushed to the scene on Jan. 6 have offered public briefings and comprehensive timelines of what happened, the department that is sworn to protect the building and its occupants has been the quietest.
Capitol Police officials have not responded to numerous requests for comment, nor has anyone in the department addressed the widely circulated videos that appear to show some officers allowing the rioters to enter the building, or treating them in a sympathetic manner, while their colleagues were being assaulted with fire extinguishers, flagpoles and hockey sticks.
The officers who have been suspended include one who took selfies with members of the crowd and another who put on a “Make America Great Again” hat and directed rioters into the Capitol, according to Mr. Ryan.
Law enforcement experts noted the apparent absence of commanders and supervisors as the mob breached the building. A memo from members of the department’s Capitol Division, written after last week’s rampage, praised Inspector Thomas M. Loyd, the division commander, for fighting “shoulder to shoulder” with the rank and file, while implicitly criticizing the rest of the leadership.
Inspector Loyd “did not retreat inside the building to attempt to ‘lead’ from his office,” said the memo, a copy of which was provided by a retired officer. “He did not stay back, away from the line, to avoid any physical conflict, but rather pulled officers off the line and took their place so they could receive medical attention.”
In an interview, Jim Konczos, a former head of the officers’ union, said the department suffered from a longstanding failure to hold the upper brass accountable for alleged misdeeds, calling it a “morale killer.”
In one instance, a commander who had an affair with a married subordinate was demoted one rank and offered a settlement that would have preserved his earlier, higher pay, according to a decision by the Office of Compliance. At the time, he was leading negotiations on the union contract.
In another, an officer assigned to protect high-ranking lawmakers racked up two charges of drunken driving, including one case in which his car struck a Maryland State Police trooper’s unmarked cruiser. The officer continued to climb the ranks, despite an internal investigation for overtime fraud.
“You get to the point where you just get so disgusted with everything — you go to the chief, go to the sergeant-at-arms, and nobody cares,” Mr. Konczos said.
The responsibilities of the Capitol Police are vastly different from those of ordinary police departments. The force protects the Capitol grounds, members of Congress and staff, and it screens millions of visitors a year. Officers are expected to recognize the 535 lawmakers and to avoid offending them.
The delicacy of that task was on full display in 1983, when a House inquiry found that the Capitol Police had botched a drug investigation by creating “the impression that the investigation may have been terminated to protect members” — while noting that, to be sure, no members had been implicated.
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
Before last week’s televised scenes of officers attacked and outnumbered, the job of a Capitol Police officer was considered relatively safe and prestigious. The pay, starting at $64,000, is higher than at other departments in the Washington metro area, and the job offers a close-up view of dignitaries and heads of state. Officers occasionally make arrests for minor crimes like smoking marijuana outside Union Station, according to a report by a watchdog group, Demand Progress, that complained of “mission creep.”
“As a rule, you’re not working robberies and homicides and burglaries and disorderly conduct,” said Terry Gainer, who had a long career in other police departments before joining the Capitol Police, where he served as the chief and then, later, as the Senate sergeant-at-arms.
For decades, providing security for “the People’s House” has meant facing criticism for being too intrusive or, just as often, too lax.
The department is overseen by a board that includes the sergeants-at-arms from each chamber, who must answer to their respective majorities and who often take politics into account, former officials said, resulting in a hamstrung force that is rarely able to take swift unilateral action.
“When things started unfolding in an emergency, you want a chief who’s empowered by the sergeant-at-arms to do what needs to be done in an emergency, without playing ‘Mother, May I,’” Mr. Gainer said. “Sometimes you had to be prepared to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.”
Steven Sund — who resigned his post as chief of the department after last week’s rampage — told The Washington Post that he had asked the sergeants-at-arms for permission to put the National Guard on standby last week, in anticipation of huge, possibly violent, crowds. But the sergeants-at-arms refused, he said, citing concerns about “optics.”
The sergeants-at-arms both resigned after last week’s breach; they have not responded to requests for comment.
Though police departments across the country can be notoriously opaque, they routinely release basic information about crime, complaints about misconduct and the racial and gender makeup of the force. The Capitol Police does not. And its officers do not wear body cameras, in part out of concerns over lawmakers’ privacy.
A bill that would have required the department to report crime statistics and strengthen its disciplinary process was introduced last summer by Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois, the ranking Republican on the committee that oversees the department. The bill went nowhere.
Allegations of gender discrimination have dogged the department for years. In lawsuits, female officers have described a culture of sexual harassment, with commanders rarely punished for lewd remarks or for sleeping with subordinates.
At the same time, they say, women have been disciplined harshly for more minor offenses. In one instance, a sergeant was demoted and suspended after she leaked reports that a fellow officer had left a gun in a restroom at the Capitol, according to court papers, while little happened to that officer.
The department has also faced repeated complaints of racism. A lawsuit filed in 2001 by more than 250 Black officers, including Ms. Blackmon-Malloy, remains unresolved, and current and former officers say the problems persist. There are no Black men on the force with a rank higher than captain.
At the same time, many of the officers who have been lauded for heroism, including the two officers who helped stop a shooting in 2017 at a congressional baseball practice, have been Black. So is Eugene Goodman, the officer who was captured on video running up the stairs in the Capitol last week, apparently luring rioters away from the Senate.
In 2015, an email from the department’s intelligence office before the Million Man March warned of potential “fireworks,” citing the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and “rabble-rousing rhetoric” by the organizer, Louis Farrakhan. A year later, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, who is Black, said he had attracted suspicion from the Capitol Police on more than one occasion.
The new acting chief, Yogananda Pittman, is both the first African-American and the first woman to lead the department. After congressional leaders urged the department to be more communicative, she issued a very brief statement.

The House of Representatives approved an article of impeachment on Wednesday charging President Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanors” for inciting supporters to assault the Capitol on Jan. 6. Mr. Trump is the first president in U.S. history to be impeached a second time.
Ten Republicans broke with Mr. Trump and voted “yes” on impeachment. One of them, Representative Tom Rice of South Carolina, was one of 147 Republicans in Congress who voted to overturn election results last week.

On Tuesday evening, the House adopted a resolution almost entirely along party lines calling on Vice President Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment to strip Mr. Trump of his powers. Ahead of the vote, Mr. Pence rejected the nonbinding resolution in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, writing that invoking the 25th Amendment would “set a terrible precedent.”
Just one Republican, Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, voted in favor of Tuesday’s resolution.

61,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/world/europe/capitol-far-right-global.html?name=styln-capitol-mob&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=a6b95cd3-5e81-11eb-9b38-158e04ddea52&variant=undefined,"BERLIN — When insurrectionists stormed the Capitol in Washington this month, far-right extremists across the Atlantic cheered. Jürgen Elsässer, the editor of Germany’s most prominent far-right magazine, was watching live from his couch.
“We were following it like a soccer match,” he said.
Four months earlier, Mr. Elsässer had attended a march in Berlin, where a breakaway mob of far-right protesters tried — and failed — to force their way into the building that houses Germany’s Parliament. The parallel was not lost on him.
“The fact that they actually made it inside raised hopes that there is a plan,” he said. “It was clear that this was something bigger.”
And it is. Adherents of racist far-right movements around the world share more than a common cause. German extremists have traveled to the United States for sniper competitions. American neo-Nazis have visited counterparts in Europe. Militants from different countries bond in training camps from Russia and Ukraine to South Africa.
For years far-right extremists traded ideology and inspiration on societies’ fringes and in the deepest realms of the internet. Now, the events of Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol have laid bare their violent potential.
In chatter on their online networks, many disavowed the storming of the Capitol as amateurish bungling. Some echoed falsehoods emanating from QAnon-affiliated channels in the United States claiming that the riot had been staged by the left to justify a clampdown on supporters of President Donald J. Trump. But many others saw it as a teaching moment — about how to move forward and pursue their goal of overturning democratic governments in more concerted and concrete ways.
It is a threat that intelligence officials, especially in Germany, take seriously. So much so that immediately after the violence in the United States, the German authorities tightened security around the Parliament building in Berlin, where far-right protesters — waving many of the same flags and symbols as the rioters in Washington — had tried to force their way in on Aug. 29.
President Biden has also ordered a comprehensive assessment of the threat from domestic violent extremism in the United States.
For now, no concrete plans for attacks have been detected in Germany, officials said. But some worry that the fallout from the events of Jan. 6 have the potential to further radicalize far-right extremists in Europe.
“Far-right extremists, corona skeptics and neo-Nazis are feeling restless,” said Stephan Kramer, the head of domestic intelligence for the eastern German state of Thuringia. There is a dangerous mix of elation that the rioters made it as far as they did and frustration that it didn’t lead to a civil war or coup, he said.
Meeting online and in person
It is difficult to say exactly how deep and durable the links are between the American far right and its European counterparts. But officials are increasingly concerned about a web of diffuse international links and worry that the networks, already emboldened in the Trump era, have become more determined since Jan. 6.
A recent report commissioned by the German foreign ministry describes “a new leaderless transnational apocalyptically minded, violent far-right extremist movement” that has emerged over the past decade.
Extremists are animated by the same conspiracy theories and narratives of “white genocide” and “the great replacement” of European populations by immigrants, the report concluded. They roam the same online spaces and also meet in person at far-right music festivals, mixed martial arts events and far-right rallies.
“The neo-Nazi scenes are well-connected,” said Mr. Kramer, the German intelligence official. “We’re not just talking about likes on Facebook. We’re talking about neo-Nazis traveling, meeting each other, celebrating together.”
The training camps have caused anxiety among intelligence and law enforcement officials, who worry that such activity could lay the groundwork for more organized and deliberate violence.
Two white nationalists, who attended a paramilitary camp run by the extremist Russian Imperial Movement outside of St. Petersburg, were later accused by Swedish prosecutors of plotting bombings aimed at asylum seekers. Last year, the United States State Department designated the Russian Imperial Movement a terrorist organization, the first white nationalist group to receive the label.
In 2019, the F.B.I director, Christopher Wray, warned that American white supremacists were traveling overseas for training with foreign nationalist groups. A report that year by the Soufan Center, a nonpartisan think tank, found that as many as 17,000 foreigners, many of them white nationalists, had traveled to Ukraine to fight on both sides of the separatist conflict there. Most were Russians, but among them were several dozen Americans.
Sometimes they inspire one another to kill.
The hate-filled manifestos of Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, and Dylann Roof, an American white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners in South Carolina four years later, influenced Brenton Harrison Tarrant, who in 2019 live-streamed his murder of over 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Mr. Tarrant’s manifesto, titled “The Great Replacement,” in turn inspired Patrick Crusius, who killed 22 people in El Paso, as well as a Norwegian gunman who was overpowered as he tried to shoot people at a mosque in Oslo.
Many far-right extremists immediately interpreted Jan. 6 as both a symbolic victory and a strategic defeat that they need to learn from.
Mr. Elsässer, the editor of Compact magazine, which Germany’s domestic intelligence agency classifies as extremist, described the storming of the Capitol as “an honorable attempt” that failed because of inadequate planning.
“The storming of a parliament by protesters as the initiation of a revolution can work,” he wrote the day after the riot. “But a revolution can only be successful if it is organized.”
“When it’s crunchtime, when you want to overthrow the regime, you need a plan and a sort of general staff,” Mr. Elsässer wrote.
Among those feeling encouraged by the mobilization seen on Jan. 6 was Martin Sellner, the Austrian head of Europe’s far-right Generation Identity movement, who preaches nonviolence but has popularized ideas like “the great replacement.”
After the storming of the Capitol, Mr. Sellner wrote: “The anger, pressure and the revolutionary mood in the camp of the patriots is in principle a positive potential.”
“Even though it fizzled out pointlessly in the storm on the Capitol, leaving behind no more than a few memes and viral videos,” he wrote, “one could form an organized and planned approach out of this mood for a more effective resistance.”
Mr. Sellner, who said in an interview that Mr. Trump would be even more galvanizing in opposition, personifies the reach of an increasingly global movement with his close links to activists across Europe and the United States. He is married to Brittany Pettibone, an American alt-right YouTube star who has interviewed prominent European extremists like the British nationalist Tommy Robinson.
Mr. Robinson met virtually with the American leader of the far-right Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, for an hour-and-a-half-long conversation on Nov. 19 that was billed as a unity summit to discuss the outcome of the American election.
The men spoke of their common struggle, against liberals, antifa (a loosely affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists) and the big tech companies that had barred both men from their platforms. They also spoke of the U.S. presidential election outcome in existential terms, warning that if the right failed to preserve the presidency for Mr. Trump, it risked annihilation.
The Democrats, Mr. Robinson said at one point, are going to “replace you like we’ve been replaced.”
“The borders will open, and they’ll replace you with foreign people,” he said.
Gaining traction in Germany
Several members of the Proud Boys, whom Mr. Trump famously told to “stand back and stand by,” were among those who stormed the Capitol.
On Oct. 19, the Proud Boys shared on one of their Telegram groups that they had seen “a huge uptick in support from Germany over the last few months.”
“A high percentage of our videos are being shared across Germany,” read a message in the Telegram group that was also translated into German. “We appreciate the support and we are praying for your country. We stand with the German nationalists who do not want migrants destroying their country.”
Over the past three months, the Proud Boys posted several videos of German police officers confronting left-wing protesters in Berlin. In two of the videos, which feature the police violently beating a protester, the Proud Boys cheered the violence.
Although they mocked Mr. Trump as “a total failure” after he disavowed the Capitol rampage and left the White House, they have voiced support for far-right groups in other countries including France, Poland and Turkey.
And as America has exported QAnon conspiracy theories across the Atlantic, European conspiracy theories and disinformation are also making their way to the United States.
Within days of the U.S. election, German QAnon followers were spreading disinformation that they said proved that the vote had been manipulated from a C.I.A.-operated server farm in Frankfurt, though millions of votes were cast by paper mail-in ballots.
The disinformation, which the German researcher Josef Holnburger traced back to a German-language account, was amplified by at least one local chapter of Alternative for Germany, the far-right political party known by its German initials, AfD. It also ended up being highlighted by U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert and Rudy Giuliani, the Trump ally and former mayor of New York City.
From there, it went viral — a first for a German QAnon conspiracy in the United States, Mr. Holnburger said.
The transnational links are inspirational rather than organizational, said Miro Dittrich, an expert on far-right extremist networks. “It’s not so much forging a concrete plan as creating a violent potential,” he said.
Yet experts remain skeptical of the potential to forge more durable trans-Atlantic relations among far-right groups. Almost all such attempts since World War II have failed, said Anton Shekhovtsov, an expert on the European far right at the University of Vienna.
Most recently, Stephen K. Bannon, the architect of Mr. Trump’s successful 2016 presidential bid, toured Europe several years ago trying to knit together populist nationalist parties like Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France and Alternative for Germany.
“It was a fiasco,” Mr. Shekhovtsov said.
Differing expectations
There’s even division among far-right followers about whether such alliances are valuable or viable. For many, the idea of an international nationalist movement is an oxymoron.
“There is a common mood and an exchange of ideas, memes and logos,” said Mr. Sellner, the Austrian far-right campaigner. “But the political camps in Europe and America are very different.”
Rinaldo Nazzaro, the founder of the international white-nationalist group The Base, now lives in self-imposed exile in St. Petersburg, Russia, but says he has no interest in forging ties with Russian nationalist groups.
“Nationalists in America must do the heavy lifting themselves,” he said. “Outside support could only be supplemental, at best.”
Others, like Matthew Heimbach, an organizer of the 2017 violent far-right protest in Charlottesville, Va., disagree.
“American members of the far right and white nationalist groups have been trying to get Europe to return their calls for a decade now,” he said in an interview.
With some success, he spent years working to forge alliances with like-minded groups in the Czech Republic, Germany and Greece.
He even hosted a delegation from the Russian Imperial Movement in 2017, several years before the United States declared it a terrorist organization. Members of the group, which runs paramilitary-style camps to train Russian and foreign nationalists in military tactics, spent two weeks in the United States and traveled extensively.
Photographs of the trip show Mr. Heimbach and one of the group’s leaders, Stanislav Shevchuk, posing with a Russian imperial flag in front of the White House and the U.S. Capitol.
Mr. Heimbach, who denounced the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and claims to have renounced white nationalism, said he had also taken his Russian guests to Dollywood and the Country Music Hall of Fame in Tennessee.
The trip, Mr. Shevchuk later wrote, “opened my eyes to a different alt-right America and I was convinced that we Russians had a lot in common with them.”

Germany’s Far Right Rebrands: Friendlier Face, Same Doctrine
HALLE, Germany — Christmas carols were playing and the scent of ginger hung in the crisp December air. Students sold organic plum compote and served mulled wine in biodegradable cups made from sugar cane. But then there were the postcards.
“Islamization? Not with us,” read one. “Defend yourself! This is your country,” urged another. “Fortress Europe,” said a third. “Shut the borders.”
This was no ordinary Christmas market, but one hosted by Generation Identity, a far-right youth movement under observation by several European intelligence services. Part hippie, part hipster, the activists of Generation Identity are one result of a broad image makeover the far right has tried to give itself in recent years.
Better dressed, better educated and less angry than the skinheads of old — at least in public — they see themselves on the front line of a counterrevolution fought by a loose but increasingly well-networked web of actors in politics, publishing, civil society and business who call themselves the “new right.”
Their aim: to bring down liberalism and rid Europe of non-European immigrants.
[Read: Germany shooting is deadliest yet in upsurge of far-right attacks in the country.]
The “new right” seeks to distance itself from the “old right,” which in Germany means neo-Nazis. Many analysts and officials consider this little more than clever rebranding. But they worry that it could allow groups like Generation Identity to act as a conduit between conservatism and extremism and draw young people into their orbit.
The number of committed Generation Identity followers in Germany is relatively small, estimated by Germany’s domestic intelligence service at 400 to 500, and there are thought to be a few thousand Europewide. But officials say the number of sympathizers is far larger.
Despite a ban from Facebook, which deprived the group of an important campaigning and fund-raising platform, its members continue to be active on YouTube, Twitter and the Russian platform VK, where slick branding amplifies their message.
“They have given extremism a friendly face,” said Stephan Kramer, the domestic intelligence chief of the east-central state of Thuringia.
Several Generation Identity activists have a past in avowed neo-Nazi circles. But their methods are straight out of a leftist playbook.
They study Gandhi and Gene Sharp, a guru of nonviolent resistance. They experiment with communal living and organic gardening. And like leftist student rebels in the 1970s or militant environmentalists in the 1990s, they stage attention-seeking flash-mob protests.
Last year, they chartered a boat in the Mediterranean to stop refugees from coming to Europe. This year they hired helicopters and temporarily closed an Alpine pass in France. In Vienna, they once covered a statue of Empress Maria Theresa with a burqa. In Berlin, they climbed onto the Brandenburg Gate to unfurl a banner that read “Secure borders — secure future.”
“We are a kind of Greenpeace for Germany,” said Philip Thaler, a 25-year-old political-science student and a co-founder of the Halle chapter of Generation Identity.
He and his fellow activists sip cafe lattes or “Identity Pils,” their own branded craft beer, and discuss the future of the welfare state, which they contend is doomed at current levels of immigration. They study and date across European borders (Mr. Thaler’s girlfriend is French).
And they pride themselves in their rebellion. “We are the punks of today,” said Ingrid Weiss, a 24-year-old Austrian activist. “If you want to be a rebel today you have to be on the right.”
Liberals are furious when far-right extremists are normalized. But it is one of the wrinkles of the new right that their lifestyles are familiar and modern — and so are some of their ideas: They bemoan rising inequality and a consumerism bereft of moral meaning.
When it comes to migration, they have purged their language of crude racism. Instead of “Germany to the Germans” or “foreigners out,” they call for “re-migration” — meaning sending immigrants who do not assimilate back to their ancestral homes.
They call themselves “ethnopluralists,” arguing that all cultures would thrive by remaining broadly homogeneous, and accuse liberal politicians of engineering a “great replacement” to supplant white Europeans with Muslims.
In this worldview, it is liberals who are undermining Western democracy by overstretching the welfare state and allowing fundamentalist Islam into the country.
“The utopia of multiculturalism was an experiment, but it has failed,” says Martin Sellner, the charismatic 29-year-old Austrian leader of the movement whose fiancée is an American YouTuber with links to the alt-right. “Like communism, cosmopolitanism has failed.”
The intellectual veneer on what is ultimately an argument against pluralism is typical of the new right, Mr. Kramer said. “When you break it down, it’s nothing but the racial theories that existed under the Nazis,” he said.
The different layers of the far right are neatly crystallized in the four-story apartment building opposite the university campus in Halle that hosted the recent Christmas market.
From the outside, the building looks innocuous enough. There are patches of graffiti on the facade and a communal garden project in the back. Rap blares from an open window. Young people in hoodies flow in and out the front door.
But inside, the ecosystem of the “new right” comes into focus: Bought by the secretive Titurel foundation, which was set up by a wealthy Bavarian donor, the building houses a bar, a library and communal living space for the activists of Generation Identity.
Up the stairs is a crowdfunding organization called “One Percent” and a far-right clothing label. There is also an office of the Institute for State Politics, a far-right think tank co-founded by the prominent publisher Götz Kubitschek, the new right’s intellectual godfather in Germany.
Until two months ago, Hans-Thomas Tillschneider, a lawmaker from the far-right party Alternative for Germany, had his office here, too. He moved out pre-emptively, as the domestic intelligence service weighs whether to start observing the party, as well.
Officially, the AfD has no links to Generation Identity. But in Halle one recent afternoon, the links were openly touted.
“We have street activists, we have a think tank, we have a publishing house and we have a political party in Parliament,” said Simon Kaupert of One Percent.
Mr. Kaupert used to work for the AfD. Over all, “dozens” of supporters of Generation Identity work for the party, he said.
Franziska Schreiber, who left the AfD last year and has written a book about the party, estimates that “at least half the members of the AfD’s own youth wing are followers of Generation Identity.”
That revolving door with AfD, now Germany’s main opposition party in Parliament, has raised concerns in intelligence circles, especially after street protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz over the summer showed the AfD and ordinary citizens marching side by side with extremists. Generation Identity activists were there, too.
Thomas Haldenwang, the new domestic intelligence chief, speaks of a “new dynamic on the right” and announced recently that he would increase the number of agents dealing with the far right by 50 percent. In January, his office is expected to decide whether the AfD will come under general observation.
“We’ve known for a long time that numerous followers of Generation Identity work for the AfD in different parliaments,” said Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker of the Greens party and deputy leader of the parliamentary committee that oversees the intelligence services. “A deliberate infiltration of democratic institutions is taking place.”
Despite having cleaned up their language, Mr. von Notz said, “They are deeply anti-Democratic, often very anti-Semitic and openly racist.”
At the recent Christmas market, activists disputed this. But they openly expressed their admiration for Hungary’s semi-authoritarian prime minister, Victor Orban, and Italy’s nationalist vice premier Matteo Salvini.
“We don’t want to become minorities in our own countries,” said Alex Malenki, a 26-year-old business student from Saxony who posts video blogs on YouTube.
Mr. Thaler said his main motivation for joining the movement had been his frustration with not being allowed to say he was proud to be German.
“If you are a patriot, if you support ethnocultural identity, you are immediately being put in the extremist corner,” he said. “I don’t want to have to justify myself for saying, yes, there is such a thing as Germany, and we want to preserve it.”
This is where liberalism has failed, Mr. Kramer said.
“These people operate in the moral vacuum that has been left by our politicians,” he said. “Patriotism, community, identity — these are instinctive needs people have and that were denied them for a long time.”
That some of their views can now be heard in Parliaments and on the street gives them a new quality. “The question is: Can we still stop it?” Mr. Kramer said. “That’s a question that concerns our liberal democracy.”"

What Is Antifa, the Movement Trump Wants to Declare a Terror Group?
President Trump has blamed anti-fascist protesters for inciting violence at protests and tried to link “far left” activists to his mainstream Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.
As President Trump and his Democratic opponent Joseph R. Biden Jr. enter the final stretch of the presidential campaign, a loosely affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists, known as “antifa,” has been the focus of a series of misleading rumors and false claims.
Seeking to assign blame for the protests against racial injustice that spread across the United States this summer, President Trump has said that the United States would designate antifa as a terrorist organization. The president’s critics noted, however, that the United States does not have a domestic terrorism law and that antifa, a contraction of the phrase “anti-fascist,” is not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles.
Rather, antifa is more of a loose movement of activists whose followers share some philosophies and tactics. They have made their presence known at protests around the country in recent years, including the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.
Mr. Trump has also sought to tie Mr. Biden to “radical left” groups, including antifa — even though Mr. Biden opposes defunding the police, has repeatedly condemned violence and property damage associated with the protests, and has called for “arsonists and anarchists” to be prosecuted.
Who are the members of antifa?
It is impossible to know how many people count themselves as members. Its followers acknowledge that the movement is secretive, has no official leaders and is organized into autonomous local cells. It is also only one in a constellation of activist movements that have come together in the past few years to oppose the far right.
Antifa members campaign against actions they view as authoritarian, homophobic, racist or xenophobic. Although antifa is not affiliated with other movements on the left — and is sometimes viewed as a distraction by other organizers — its members sometimes work with other local activist networks that are rallying around the same issues, such as the Occupy movement or Black Lives Matter.
Misinformation about the group often spreads through personal networks online. In many cases, false or misleading claims appear first in a tweet, Facebook post or YouTube video before they are shared through community texting networks, Facebook groups or the neighborhood social networking app Nextdoor.
What are its goals?
Supporters generally seek to stop what they see as fascist, racist and far-right groups from having a platform to promote their views, arguing that public demonstration of those ideas leads to the targeting of marginalized people, including racial minorities, women and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
“The argument is that militant anti-fascism is inherently self-defense because of the historically documented violence that fascists pose, especially to marginalized people,” said Mark Bray, a history lecturer at Rutgers University and the author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.”
Many antifa organizers also participate in more peaceful forms of community organizing, but they believe that using violence is justified because of their views that if racist or fascist groups are allowed to organize freely, “it will inevitably result in violence against marginalized communities,” said Mr. Bray, whose defense of the anti-fascist movement incited criticism and generated support at Dartmouth College when he was a lecturer there.
When did the movement begin?
Although the Merriam-Webster dictionary says the word “antifa” was first used in 1946 and was borrowed from a German phrase signaling an opposition to Nazism, more people began joining the movement in the United States after the 2016 election of Mr. Trump, to counter the threat they believed was posed by the so-called alt-right, Mr. Bray said.
One of the first groups in the United States to use the name was Rose City Antifa, which says it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore. It has a large following on social media, where it shares news articles and sometimes seeks to dox, or reveal the identities and personal information of, figures on the right.
The antifa movement gained more visibility in 2017 after a series of events that put a spotlight on anti-fascist protesters, including the punching of a prominent alt-right member; the cancellation of an event by a right-wing writer at the University of California, Berkeley; and their confrontation of white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville who turned violent.
What distinguishes antifa from other protest groups?
Mr. Bray said antifa groups often use tactics similar to anarchist groups, such as dressing in all black and wearing masks. The groups also have overlapping ideologies, as both often criticize capitalism and seek to dismantle structures of authority, including police forces.
How have politicians and others reacted?
The movement has been widely criticized among the mainstream left and right. After the protests in Berkeley, Calif., in August 2017, Speaker Nancy Pelosi decried “the violent actions of people calling themselves antifa” and said they should be arrested.
Conservative publications and politicians routinely rail against supporters of antifa, who they say are seeking to shut down peaceful expression of conservative views. These critics point to moments during which purported antifa members have been accused of sucker-punching Trump supporters.
But overblown fears and false claims about antifa can be dangerous in and of themselves. In Oregon, for example, after a wave of misinformation about left-wing activists intentionally setting fires began to interfere with firefighters’ efforts to contain the blazes there, law enforcement officials begged people to “STOP. SPREADING. RUMORS!”
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University who studies fascism, said she was worried that antifa’s methods could feed into what she said were false equivalencies that seek to lump violence on the left with attacks by the right, such as the killing of a protester in Charlottesville by a man who had expressed white supremacist views.
“Throwing a milkshake is not equivalent to killing someone, but because the people in power are allied with the right, any provocation, any dissent against right-wing violence, backfires,” Professor Ben-Ghiat said in an interview last year.
Between 2010 and 2016, 53 percent of terrorist attacks in the United States were carried out by religious extremists — 35 percent by right-wing extremists and 12 percent by left-wing or environmentalist extremists, according to a University of Maryland-led consortium that studies terrorism.
Militancy on the left can “become a justification for those in power and allies on the right to crack down,” Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “In these situations, the left, or antifa, are historically placed in impossible situations.”

‘A Total Failure’: The Proud Boys Now Mock Trump
After the presidential election last year, the Proud Boys, a far-right group, declared its undying loyalty to President Trump.
In a Nov. 8 post in a private channel of the messaging app Telegram, the group urged its followers to attend protests against an election that it said had been fraudulently stolen from Mr. Trump. “Hail Emperor Trump,” the Proud Boys wrote.
But by this week, the group’s attitude toward Mr. Trump had changed. “Trump will go down as a total failure,” the Proud Boys said in the same Telegram channel on Monday.
As Mr. Trump departed the White House on Wednesday, the Proud Boys, once among his staunchest supporters, have also started leaving his side. In dozens of conversations on social media sites like Gab and Telegram, members of the group have begun calling Mr. Trump a “shill” and “extraordinarily weak,” according to messages reviewed by The New York Times. They have also urged supporters to stop attending rallies and protests held for Mr. Trump or the Republican Party.
The comments are a startling turn for the Proud Boys, which for years had backed Mr. Trump and promoted political violence. Led by Enrique Tarrio, many of its thousands of members were such die-hard fans of Mr. Trump that they offered to serve as his private militia and celebrated after he told them in a presidential debate last year to “stand back and stand by.” On Jan. 6, some Proud Boys members stormed the U.S. Capitol.
But since then, discontent with Mr. Trump, who later condemned the violence, has boiled over. On social media, Proud Boys participants have complained about his willingness to leave office and said his disavowal of the Capitol rampage was an act of betrayal. And Mr. Trump, cut off on Facebook and Twitter, has been unable to talk directly to them to soothe their concerns or issue new rallying cries.
The Proud Boys’ anger toward Mr. Trump has heightened after he did nothing to help those in the group who face legal action for the Capitol violence. On Wednesday, a Proud Boy leader, Joseph Biggs, 37, was arrested in Florida and charged with unlawful entry and corruptly obstructing an official proceeding in the riot. At least four other members of the group also face charges stemming from the attack.
“When Trump told them that if he left office, America would fall into an abyss, they believed him,” Arieh Kovler, a political consultant and independent researcher in Israel who studies the far right, said of the Proud Boys. “Now that he has left office, they believe he has both surrendered and failed to do his patriotic duty.”
The shift raises questions about the strength of the support for Mr. Trump and suggests that pockets of his fan base are fracturing. Many of Mr. Trump’s fans still falsely believe he was deprived of office, but other far-right groups such as the Oath Keepers, America First and the Three Percenters have also started criticizing him in private Telegram channels, according to a review of messages.
Last week, Nicholas Fuentes, the leader of America First, wrote in his Telegram channel that Mr. Trump’s response to the Capitol rampage was “very weak and flaccid” and added, “Not the same guy that ran in 2015.”
On Wednesday, the Proud Boys Telegram group welcomed President Biden to office. “At least the incoming administration is honest about their intentions,” the group wrote.
Mr. Kovler said the activity showed that groups that had coalesced around Mr. Trump were now trying to figure out their future direction. By losing his ability to post on Twitter and Facebook, Mr. Trump had also become less useful to the far-right groups, who counted on him to raise their profile on a national stage, Mr. Kovler said.
Mr. Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not respond to a request for comment.
The Proud Boys were founded in 2016 as a club for men by Gavin McInnes, who also was a founder of the online publication Vice. Describing themselves as “Western chauvinists,” the group attracted people who appeared eager to engage in violence and who frequently espoused anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic views. The group had supported Mr. Trump since he assumed office.
The change toward Mr. Trump happened slowly. After November’s election, the group’s private Telegram channels, Gab pages and posts on the alternative social networking site Parler were filled with calls to keep the faith with the president. Many Proud Boys, echoing Mr. Trump’s falsehoods, said the election had been rigged, according to a review of messages.
The Proud Boys urged their members to attend “Stop the Steal” rallies. One Nov. 23 message on a Proud Boys Telegram page read, “No Trump, no peace.” The message linked to information about a rally in front of the governor’s home in Georgia.
As Mr. Trump’s legal team battled the election result with lawsuits, the Proud Boys closely followed the court cases and appeals in different states, posting frequent links in their Telegram channels to news reports.
But when Mr. Trump’s legal efforts failed, the Proud Boys called for him on social media to use his presidential powers to stay in office. Some urged him to declare martial law or take control by force. In the last two weeks of December, they pushed Mr. Trump in their protests and on social media to “Cross the Rubicon.”
“They wanted to arm themselves and start a second civil war and take down the government on Trump’s behalf,” said Marc-André Argentino, a researcher who studies the far right and a Ph.D. candidate at Concordia University. “But ultimately, he couldn’t be the authoritarian they wanted him to be.”
Then came the week of the Capitol storming. On Jan. 4, Mr. Tarrio was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter banner torn from a Black church in Washington. He was thrown out of the city by a judge the next day.
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment

Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
But nearly 100 other Proud Boys, who had been encouraged by leaders like Mr. Biggs, remained in Washington. According to court papers, Mr. Biggs told members to eschew their typical black-and-yellow polo shirts and instead go “incognito” and move about the city in “smaller teams.”
On the day of the riot, Mr. Biggs was captured in a video marching with a large group of Proud Boys toward the Capitol, chanting slogans like, “Whose streets? Our streets.”
Though prosecutors said Mr. Biggs was not among the first to break into the Capitol, they said he admitted to entering the building for a brief time. They also said he appeared to wear a walkie-talkie-style device on his chest, suggesting he was communicating with others during the incursion.
In an interview with The Times hours after the attack, Mr. Biggs said he and other Proud Boys arrived at the Capitol complex around 1 p.m. when the crowd in front of them surged and the mood grew violent. “It literally happened in seconds,” he said.
Prosecutors have also charged Dominic Pezzola, a Proud Boy from Rochester and a former Marine; Nicholas Ochs, founder of the Proud Boys’ Hawaii chapter; and Nicholas DeCarlo, who runs a news outfit called Murder the Media, which is associated with the group.
After the violence, the Proud Boys expected Mr. Trump — who had earlier told his supporters to “fight much harder” against “bad people” — to champion the mob, according to their social media messages. Instead, Mr. Trump began distancing himself from his remarks and released a video on Jan. 8 denouncing the violence.
The disappointment was immediately palpable. One Proud Boys Telegram channel posted: “It really is important for us all to see how much Trump betrayed his supporters this week. We are nationalists 1st and always. Trump was just a man and as it turns out an extraordinarily weak one at the end.”
Some Proud Boys became furious that Mr. Trump, who was impeached for inciting the insurrection, did not appear interested in issuing presidential pardons for their members who were arrested. In a Telegram post on Friday, they accused Mr. Trump of “instigating” the events at the Capitol, adding that he then “washed his hands of it.”
“They thought they had his support and that, ultimately, Trump would come through for them, including with a pardon if they should need it,” said Jared Holt, a visiting research fellow at the Atlantic Council’s DFR Lab. “Now they realize they went too far in the riots.”
Some Proud Boys now say in online posts that the group should “go dark” and retreat from political life by cutting its affiliation to any political party. They are encouraging one another to focus their energies on secessionist movements and local protests.
“To all demoralized Trump supporters: There is hope,” read one message in a Proud Boys Telegram channel on Wednesday. “There is an alternative. Abandon the GOP and the Dems.”"

It was the table setter for what would come, with nearly 2,000 people gathering in Washington on Tuesday evening for a “Rally to Save America.” Speaker after angry speaker stoked stolen-election conspiracy theories and name-checked sworn enemies: Democrats and weak Republicans, Communists and Satanists.
Still, the crowd seemed a bit giddy at the prospect of helping President Trump reverse the result of the election — though at times the language evoked a call to arms. “It is time for war,” one speaker declared.
As the audience thinned, groups of young men emerged in Kevlar vests and helmets, a number of them holding clubs and knives. Some were aligned with the neofascist Proud Boys; others with the Three Percenters, a far-right militia group.
“We’re not backing down anymore,” said a man with fresh stitches on his head. “This is our country.”
That night reflected a disconcerting mix of free speech and certain menace; of everyday Americans supporting their president and extremists prepared to commit violence for him. All had assembled in answer to Mr. Trump’s repeated appeals to attend a march to the Capitol the next day that he promised would be “wild.”
It was. By Wednesday afternoon, a narrow group of Trump supporters — some exuberant, some hellbent — had been storm-tossed together into infamy. A mob overran the nation’s Capitol, as lawmakers hid in fear. Wholesale vandalism. Tear gas. Gunfire. A woman dead; an officer dead; many injured. Chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!”
But the insurrection failed.
It had been the culmination of a sustained assault by the president and his enablers on fact-based reality, one that began long before the November election but took on a fevered urgency as the certainty of Mr. Trump’s defeat solidified. For years, he had demonized political opponents and the media and egged on thuggish behavior at his rallies.
Since losing to Joseph R. Biden Jr., he had mounted a campaign of lies that the presidency was being stolen from him, and that marching on the Capitol was the last chance to stop it. To many Americans, it looked like one more feel-good rally to salve Mr. Trump’s wounded ego, but some of his supporters heard something altogether different — a battle cry.
Now, dozens of them have been arrested — including an armed Alabama man who had Molotov cocktails in his car and a West Virginia lawmaker charged with illegally entering the Capitol — and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is asking for help in identifying those who “actively instigated violence.” Many participants in the march are frantically working to erase digital evidence of their presence for fear of losing a job or being harassed online.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been broadly condemned and cut off from his social media megaphones, as a new administration prepares to take power.
Kevin Haag, 67, a retired landscaper from North Carolina who ascended the Capitol steps as the crowd surged forward, said he did not go inside and disapproved of those who did. Even so, he said he would never forget the sense of empowerment as he looked down over thousands of protesters. It felt so good, he said, to show people: “We are here. See us! Notice us! Pay attention!”
Now, back home after several days of reflection, Mr. Haag, an evangelical Christian, wonders whether he went too far. “Should I get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness?” he said in an interview. “I am asking myself that question.”
But the experience seemed to have only hardened the resolve of others. Couy Griffin, 47, a Republican county commissioner from New Mexico, spoke of organizing another Capitol rally soon — one that could result in “blood running out of that building” — in a video he later posted to the Facebook page of his group, Cowboys for Trump.
“At the end of the day, you mark my word, we will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,” he said. He paused before adding, “And Donald J. Trump if it boils down to it.”
Plans take shape online: ‘Pack a crowbar’
The advance publicity for the “March for America” had been robust. Beyond the repeated promotions in tweets by the president and his allies, the upcoming event was cheered on social media, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
But woven through many of the messages to stand up for Mr. Trump — and, if possible, block the congressional certification of the election he claimed he had won — was language that flirted with aggression, even violence.
For example, the term “Storm the Capitol” was mentioned 100,000 times in the 30 days preceding Jan. 6, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company. Many of these mentions appeared in viral tweet threads that discussed the possible storming of the Capitol and included details on how to enter the building.
To followers of QAnon, the convoluted collection of conspiracy theories that falsely claims the country is dominated by deep-state bureaucrats and Democrats who worship Satan, the word “storm” had particular resonance. Adherents have often referred to a coming storm, after which Mr. Trump would preside over a new government order.
In online discussions, some QAnon followers and militia groups explored which weapons and tools to bring. “Pack a crowbar,” read one message posted on Gab, a social media refuge for the far right. In another discussion, someone asked, “Does anyone know if the windows on the second floor are reinforced?”
Still, the many waves of communication did not appear to result in a broadly organized plan to take action. It is also unclear if any big money or coordinated fund-raising was behind the mobilization, though some Trump supporters appear to have found funds through opaque online networks to help pay for transportation to the rally.
“Patriots, if you need financial help getting to DC to support President Trump on January 6th, please go to my website,” a QAnon adherent who identified himself as Thad Williams, of Tampa, Fla., posted on Twitter three days before the event. He said he had raised more than $27,000. (After the Capitol assault, the money transfer companies PayPal and Stripe shut down his accounts. Mr. Williams did not return a phone message, but the website for his organization, Joy In Liberty, said it had given out $30,000 to fund transportation for “deserving patriots.”)
Other rally goers set up fund-raising accounts through the online service GoFundMe; Buzzfeed News cited at least a dozen, and GoFundMe has since closed them.
One of the most conspicuous figures in the Capitol assault — a bare-chested man with a painted face, flag-draped spear and fur hat with horns — was linked to the online fund-raising. A familiar presence at pro-Trump rallies in Phoenix, Jacob Anthony Chansley, a 33-year-old voice-over actor, is known as the Q Shaman. He started a GoFundMe account in December to help pay for transportation to another Trump demonstration in Washington, but the effort reportedly netted him just $10. Mr. Chansley retweeted Mr. Williams’s funding offer on Jan. 3, but it is unclear whether he benefited from it.
On Tuesday, the eve of the march, a couple thousand people gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington for “The Rally to Save America” event, permitted as “The Rally to Revival.” The disparate interests of those attending were reflected by the speakers: well-known evangelists, alt-right celebrities (Alex Jones of Infowars) and Trump loyalists, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the self-described Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone, both of whom he had pardoned.
The speakers repeatedly encouraged the attendees to see themselves as foot soldiers fighting to save the country. Americans, Mr. Flynn said, were ready to “bleed” for freedom.
“The members of the House of Representatives, the members of the United States Senate, those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don’t have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight,” he said. “Because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here and we want you to know we will not stand for a lie.”
Then came tomorrow.
Inside, the Capitol descends into chaos
It was President Trump’s turn. At about noon on Wednesday, he emerged from a viewing party in a tent, strode onto a stage set up in a park just south of the White House and, for more than an hour, delivered a stream of inflammatory words.
He exhorted the crowd of more than 8,000 to march to the Capitol to pressure lawmakers: “Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.”
Even before he had finished speaking, people started moving east toward the Capitol. The crowd included supporters who had come by caravan from across the country, Trump flags rippling in the wind, as well as people so moved by the president’s appeal for support that they had jumped into their cars and driven for hours.
They traveled from various corners of resentment in 21st-century America. Whether motivated by a sense of economic disenfranchisement or distrust of government, by bigotry, or conspiracy or a belief that Mr. Trump is God’s way of preparing for the Rapture, they shared a fealty to the president.
Now the moment had come, a moment that twinned the thrilling with the ominous.
“I’m happy, sad, afraid, excited,” said Scott Cyganiewicz, 56, a floor installer from Gardner, Mass., as he watched the throngs of Trump loyalists streaming through the streets. “It’s an emotional roller coaster.”
Mr. Cyganiewicz said he was on his way out of town. He did not want to be around if violence broke out. Only a portion of the broader crowd continued onto the Capitol grounds.
Soon word spread that Vice President Mike Pence — who would oversee the pro forma count by Congress of the electoral votes for certification — had announced he would not be complicit in the president’s efforts to overturn the election.
“You can imagine the emotion that ran through people when we get that word,” said Mr. Griffin, the county commissioner from New Mexico, in a video he posted on social media. “And then we get down to the Capitol and they have all the inauguration set up for Joe Biden.”
He added, “What do you think was going to happen?”
Many in the crowd spoke portentously of violence — or even of another Civil War. A man named Jeff, who said he was an off-duty police officer from York County, Pa., said he didn’t know what would happen after he and his wife Amy reached the Capitol. But he felt ready to participate if something were to erupt.
“There’s a lot of people here willing to take orders,” he said. “If the orders are given, the people will rise up.”
By the time the bulk of the crowd reached the building, its leading edge had metastasized into an angry mob. A man barked into a megaphone: “Keep moving forward! Fight for Trump, fight for Trump!”
“Military Tribunals! Hang them!” shouted someone wearing a cowboy hat.
“Arrest Congress!” screamed a woman in a flag scarf.
People surged past a few Capitol Police officers to bang on the windows and doors. Many eyewitness accounts and videos have since emerged that convey the pandemonium as hundreds of people overwhelmed the inadequate law-enforcement presence. In several instances of role reversal, for example, rioters are seen firing what appeared to be pepper spray at police officers trying to prevent mobs from getting closer to the Capitol Building.
After a few minutes, the crowd broke through and began streaming into an empty office. Glass shards crunched under people’s feet, as the scene descended into chaos.
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
Some stood in awe, while others took action. As one group prepared to break through an entryway, a Trump supporter raised a wine bottle and shouted, “Whose way?” To which the crowd responded, “Our way!”
Confusion reigned. “Hey what’s the Senate side?” said a tall man in camouflage and sunglasses. “Where’s the Senate? Can somebody Google it?”
All the while, members of The Oath Keepers, a self-proclaimed citizens’ militia, seemed to be standing guard — for the transgressors. They wore olive-drab shirts, helmets and patches on their upper-left sleeves that said, “Guardians of the Republic” and “Not on Our Watch.”
American flags flapped beside “Trump 2020” flags, and people wearing “Make America Great Again” regalia moved beside people wearing anti-Semitic slogans. Chants of “Hell No, Never Joe” and “Stop the Steal” broke out, as did strains of “God Bless America” and “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Derrick Evans of West Virginia, who just two months before had been elected as a Republican state delegate, wandered the halls of the Capitol Building, filming himself and joining in the occasional chant. At one point he shouted, “Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!”
Outside the building, Mr. Griffin, who was once photographed wearing a 10-gallon hat and sitting across from President Trump in the Oval Office, was now gleefully addressing the camera from atop one of the crowded terraces, declaring it “a great day for America.” Asserting that “we came peacefully,” he was interrupted by a man wearing a jacket with a hand-grenade logo, who said, “Believe me, we are well armed if we need to be.”
Amid the cheers and whoops of excitement were questions of what to do next. Some can be heard hunting for specific members of congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose office was broken into by several people. She and other lawmakers were hiding for fear of their safety.
One image showed a trim man moving through the Senate chamber in full paramilitary regalia: camouflage uniform, Kevlar vest, a mask and baseball cap obscuring his face. He carried a stack of flex cuffs — the plastic restraints used by police. The image raised a question yet to be answered: Why carry restraints if not to use them?
Several rioters wielded fire extinguishers. One stood on a balcony on the Capitol building’s west side, spraying down on police officers trying to fend off the crowd. Others carried them into the building itself, one into Statuary Hall and another onto the steps outside the Senate Chamber, spraying in the direction of journalists and police officers.
“Our president wants us here,” a man can be heard saying during a livestream video that showed him standing within the Capitol building. “We wait and take orders from our president.”
Despite his followers’ hopes and expectations, President Trump was missing in action as rioters rampaged through the halls of Congress. It would be hours before he eventually surfaced in a somewhat subdued videotaped appeal for them to leave.
“We have to have peace,” he said. “So go home, we love you, you’re very special.”
Some of Mr. Trump’s supporters expressed frustration, even disbelief, that the president seemed to have given up after they had put themselves on the line for him.
Mr. Haag, the retired landscaper, was among the disappointed. Still, he said, the movement will continue even without Mr. Trump.
“We are representing the 74 million people who got disenfranchised,” he said. “We are still out here. We are a force to be reckoned with. We are not going away.”
One man wandered away from the Capitol in the evening gloom, yelling angrily through a megaphone that Mr. Pence was a coward and, now, Mr. Trump had told everyone “to just go home.”
“Well, he can go home to his Mar-a-Lago estate,” the man shouted, adding, “We gotta go back to our businesses that are closed!”
As some rioters face fallout, others mull a repeat
In the aftermath of what Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called a “failed insurrection,” scores of those who responded to the incendiary words of the president now face a reckoning.
A chief target of investigators will be whoever struck Brian Sicknick of the Capitol Police with a fire extinguisher; the 42-year-old officer died Thursday after being injured in the riot. At the same time, authorities are investigating the fatal police shooting of Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran who had joined those breaching the Capitol.
Among those charged so far with federal crimes are Mr. Chansley, the so-called Q Shaman; Mr. Evans, the West Virginia lawmaker — who resigned on Saturday; and Richard Barnett, an Arkansas man who was depicted in a widely circulated photograph sitting with his foot on a desk in Ms. Pelosi’s office.
Meanwhile, Mr. Griffin, the commissioner from New Mexico who runs Cowboys for Trump, saw his group’s Twitter account suspended and calls for his resignation.
The anger, resentment and conspiracy-laced distrust that led to Wednesday’s mayhem did not dissipate with Thursday’s dawn. Along with the smashed furniture in the Capitol Building, there were smashed expectations of a continued Trump presidency, of lawmakers held to account, of holy prophecies fulfilled.
Signs of potential violence have already surfaced. Twitter, which terminated Mr. Trump’s account on Friday, noted that “plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating” online, including “a proposed secondary attack on the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17.”
The urge for more civil unrest is being discussed in the usual squalid corners of the internet. Private chat groups on Gab and Parler are peppered with talk of a possible “Million Militia March” on Jan. 20 that would disrupt the presidential inauguration of Mr. Biden.
There is chatter about ride shares, where to find lodging in the Washington area — and what to bring. Baseball bats, perhaps, or assault rifles.
“We took the building once,” one commenter posted, “we can take it again.”

Incitement to Riot? What Trump Told Supporters Before Mob Stormed Capitol
Here is a closer look at what the president said at a rally of his supporters, which is a central focus of the impeachment case being prepared against him.
WASHINGTON — The speech that President Trump delivered to his supporters just before they attacked the Capitol last week is a central focus as House Democrats prepare an article of impeachment against him for inciting the deadly riot.
Mr. Trump had urged supporters to come to Washington for a “Save America March” on Wednesday, when Congress would ceremonially count President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s win, telling them to “be there, will be wild!” At a rally just before the violence, he repeated many of his falsehoods about how the election was stolen, then dispatched the marchers to the Capitol as those proceedings were about to start.
Here are some notable excerpts from Mr. Trump’s remarks, with analysis.
Trump urged his supporters to ‘fight much harder’ against ‘bad people’ and ‘show strength’ at the Capitol.
“Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It’s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we’re going to have to fight much harder. …
“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”
The president’s speech was riddled with violent imagery and calls to fight harder than before. By contrast, he made only a passing suggestion that the protest should be nonviolent, saying, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”
During Mr. Trump’s impeachment last year, one of his defenses was that the primary accusation against him — that he abused his power by withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get its president to announce a corruption investigation into Mr. Biden — was not an ordinary crime, so it did not matter even if it were true. Most legal specialists said that made no difference for impeachment purposes, but in any case that argument would not be a defense here. Several laws clearly make it a crime to incite a riot or otherwise try to get another person to engage in a violent crime against property or people.
Trump told the crowd that ‘very different rules’ applied.
“When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening to.”
Whipping up anger against Republicans who were not going along with his plan for subverting the election, like Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Trump told the crowd that “different rules” now applied. At the most obvious level, the president was arguing that what he wanted Mr. Pence to do — reject the state-certified Electoral College results — would be legitimate, but the notion of “very different rules” applying carried broader overtones of extraordinary permission as well. (“RINO” is a term of abuse used by highly partisan Republicans against more moderate colleagues they deem to be “Republicans in Name Only.”)
Trump insinuated that Republican officials, including Pence, would endanger themselves by accepting Biden’s win.
“I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so, because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. … And I actually — I just spoke to Mike. I said: ‘Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.’”
“I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate, Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley. … Senators have stepped up. We want to thank them. I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out. And you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.”
Mr. Trump twice told the crowd that Republicans who did not go along with his effort to overturn the election — Mr. Pence as well as senators like Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who did not join in the performative objections led by Mr. Hawley and Mr. Cruz — were actually the ones being courageous. In context, the president’s implication is that they were putting themselves at risk because it would be safer to go along with what he wanted. During the ensuing riot, the mob chanted “Hang Mike Pence.”
The Trump Impeachment ›
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by Mr. Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
Trump suggested that he wanted his supporters to stop the certification of Biden’s electoral win, not just protest it.
“We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore, and that is what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal. …
“You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can’t let that happen. These are the facts that you won’t hear from the fake news media. It’s all part of the suppression effort. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it. …
“We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”
Two months after he lost the election, Mr. Trump repeatedly told his followers that they could still stop Mr. Biden from becoming president if they “fight like hell,” a formulation that suggested they act and change things, not merely raise their voices in protest.
As he dispatched his supporters into what became deadly chaos, Trump falsely told them that he would come, too.
Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you. … We are going to the Capitol, and we are going to try and give — the Democrats are hopeless, they are never voting for anything, not even one vote, but we are going to try — give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re try — going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”
As he sicced his supporters on Congress, Mr. Trump assured them that he would personally accompany them to the Capitol. In fact, as several of his followers and police officers were being injured or dying in the ensuing chaos, the president was watching the violence play out on television from the safety of the White House."

The day’s events were captured by protesters and witnesses who live-streamed the action or posted the scenes on social media. The footage shows the simultaneous and alternating perspectives of Mr. Trump at the podium, the lawmakers inside the Capitol and the swelling numbers — and growing violence — of the rioters on the ground.

A Brewing Storm

For weeks, Mr. Trump had urged his supporters to go to Washington to stop the certification of the election results, and several simultaneous rallies were planned for Wednesday.
As the morning arrives, hundreds assemble on the Capitol lawn, more than a mile away from where Trump will soon speak near the White House. Among them are the Proud Boys, a far-right group, identifiable here by their orange hats.

Schools in the Pandemic: A Report Card
‘The Word of the Year Is Fluid’: The Pandemic Brings a New Teaching Style
Like many districts nationwide, schools in Edison, N.J., are struggling to make hybrid instruction work.
EDISON, N.J. — This is Stephanie Rasimowicz’s daily dilemma: Scattered before her in second-period geometry class at Edison High School are a handful of freshmen, seated at desks many feet apart. Arrayed behind her are nearly 20 small, disembodied faces on a computer screen — her remote students, learning from home.
Can the remote students hear the students in the classroom, and vice versa? Which group should she focus on today? And how does she know if those remote students are grasping her lessons — or paying attention at all?
“Even if their cameras are on, you still don’t know exactly what they’re doing at home,” said Ms. Rasimowicz, who has taught math at Edison High for 13 years.
Ms. Rasimowicz and the rest of Edison Township Public Schools, one of New Jersey’s largest suburban districts, are part of a huge, unplanned educational experiment: combining remote instruction with in-person classes, a system known as hybrid instruction.

Hybrid for about a quarter of students, who come to school four mornings a week. The rest learn remotely.
By some estimates, hybrid learning has become among the most common approaches to teaching in the pandemic, with thousands of the nation’s 13,000 school districts using it for some or most classes.
In some places, most notably New York City, hybrid students come into classrooms for part of the week and study at home the rest of the time, with a different teacher for each group. (Most New York City students have remained all-remote.) In most other districts, hybrid involves one teacher simultaneously instructing in-person and remote students who shift places every second or third day. In Edison, in-person students come to class four mornings a week.
The compromises built into hybrid are intended to keep staff members and students safer — by slicing in-person attendance by at least half to enable six feet of distance in classrooms, hallways and gymnasiums — while also maintaining, at least in part, the widely acknowledged educational and emotional benefits of in-person instruction.
“There’s no book for this,” said Cyndi Tufaro, the principal of James Monroe Elementary School in Edison. “The word of the year is ‘fluid.’”
A growing body of research indicates that students generally have fallen behind educationally in the pandemic, with Black, Latino and low-income students, who are more likely to be taking classes remotely, faring the worst. Whether hybrid classes are helping to stem educational loss remains unclear.
Edison officials said they had no readily available data on failure rates or standardized test scores to measure the impact of hybrid learning.
Ms. Rasimowicz believes that the pandemic has wrought an educational toll, though perhaps not as significantly as she once feared. “I have the same number of kids who struggle,” she said. “The same number who have A’s.”
But the jury is out on hybrid learning, she adds. “The more difficult topics — you can’t push them as far,” she said.
Edison, home to a large Indian-American community about 40 miles southwest of Midtown Manhattan, is one of the most diverse suburban communities in the state. The school district is about 65 percent Asian, 14 percent white, 11 percent Latino and 8 percent Black.
The district has seesawed between different hybrid models as coronavirus cases have receded and spiked again.
School began virtually in September, reopened in October for willing students to attend in-person every other day, and then a month later allowed those students to attend class four mornings a week.
Only about one in four of the district’s 17,000 students come to school for in-person instruction; the rest take all their classes from home. Schools are closed each Wednesday for cleaning, and all students take their afternoon classes online.

Bernard F. Bragen Jr., the district’s superintendent, tried to maintain in-person instruction for as long as possible, even as most nearby districts closed when the virus began surging across the state late last year.
For nearly two months, there was limited virus spread linked to in-school transmission, and only one of Edison’s 19 schools was forced to shut down for two weeks. But by the first week of December, six additional schools reported outbreaks involving at least 22 cases, and Edison temporarily shifted everyone back to all-remote instruction. All schools are scheduled to reopen on Feb. 1.
The township remembers the risks of the virus well: During the spring, as many as 102 patients and one staff member at the Menlo Park Veterans Memorial Home in Edison died after confirmed or probable cases of Covid-19, according to state officials.
Dr. Bragen said he worried most about children at the fringes of poverty — about 15 percent of Edison students are poor enough to qualify for free school lunches — as well as those slipping deeper into emotional crisis. “The number of students in crisis has increased, and it’s concerning,” he said.
He is also concerned about teacher burnout from the incessant demands of instructing remote and in-person students simultaneously. “For a teacher to meet the needs of the students seated in front of them and to meet the needs of students sitting at home is a challenge,” he said. “One is always being compromised for the other.”
He and district leaders tried to develop a new hybrid model that would have enabled staff members who preferred to remain home to teach only virtual classes, while those in school would be responsible solely for the students who attend class in person. But they were unable to make it work because it would have required reassigning too many teachers.
Many of Edison’s elementary classrooms were outfitted with cameras suspended from ceilings so that students at home have the same view of the teacher as those in the classroom. Using federal CARES Act funding, the district also hung 25 thermal cameras costing $12,000 each in entryways to instantaneously measure body temperatures and check for masks.
Still, teachers and students face connectivity snags associated with adding new technology to old buildings.
“Things I never, ever want to say after Covid-19?” Vicki Jenkins, a dance teacher, said into a MacBook Air propped on a shelf in her classroom studio last month. “I can’t hear you. You’re frozen. It’s lagging.”
The virtual holiday dance show was weeks away, and she had been kicked offline twice in 20 minutes while leading her students through their routines.
Is coming into the classroom for so few students worth it? “It’s worth it for that one child or the few children who are there,” Ms. Jenkins said. “But there are days — and today was one of them — when I ask: ‘What am I doing here?’”
For one of her students, Zaria Fogle, the frustrations of online instruction prodded her to return to the classroom when the district reopened in October. Zaria, a 17-year-old senior at Edison High, said that in-person instruction was key to maintaining honor-roll grades.
“I really could not learn math over the computer,” said Zaria, who hopes to study dance in college.
Showing up in person also offers at least a taste of a typical senior year and a chance to fulfill a responsibility: She was selected to give the school’s morning announcements over the loudspeaker.
But mostly, it’s the lure of the mirror-lined dance studio, where Zaria goes as often as she can.
“That’s one of the only normal things I get to do,” she said. “It’s better than just dancing in my room.”"

Schools in the Pandemic: A Report Card
What One District Did to Prevent Students From Failing
Academic performance rose when a tiny Texas district required all students to attend class in person. But so did coronavirus infections.
LUBBOCK, Texas — Madison Hermosillo started her sophomore year at Roosevelt High School alone in her room, bewildered and quickly falling behind.
Set among cotton fields and oil derricks outside Lubbock, Texas, her school was open for in-person classes. But coronavirus cases were rampant, and her mother decided to keep her home.

Madison, who is 16, muddled through remote assignments in geometry, chemistry and world geography. Soon, she was failing in every class but gym.
“My mom would tell me to go do it, and I would just go in my room and watch TikTok on my phone,” she said.
She was not the only one. By the end of the first grading period in September, 77 percent of the district’s remote high school students were failing at least one class. Those who opted to attend in person, by contrast, were mostly passing.
Similarly, about 30 percent of the youngest students, particularly in first and second grades, were not meeting grade-level expectations on a reading assessment administered at the start of the school year — roughly double the number from previous years, Delynn Wheeler, the elementary school principal, said.
To district officials, that was evidence that remote education last spring had set students back. And those who remained remote at the start of the fall semester struggled to catch up.

So the district took a drastic step: It ended its remote instructional option and required all of its 1,010 students — from prekindergarten to the 12th grade — to return to the classroom.
“This works for us in our little school district,” said Dallas Grimes, the superintendent. “It’s not going to work everywhere.”
The Roosevelt Independent School District resembles many others across Texas: small and rural, with a heavily Hispanic student population, including many living in poverty. Like others, the district struggled to provide remote instruction, despite creating mobile hot spots for students without internet and checking in frequently with those falling behind.
The results of mandating in-person instruction have been mixed. Dozens of teachers, staff and students have been infected, and many more have had to quarantine at home because of exposure. The absences have disrupted everything from classroom instruction to building maintenance.
But teachers and administrators said the best thing for their students was to be in school.
“When those kids were walking through that door, it was good,” said Theresa Hoffman, assistant principal in the district’s elementary school, recalling her emotion at watching students return. “The schools that didn’t do that — I just can’t imagine.”
The entire Roosevelt Independent School District sits on one campus, along a straight, flat country road. A fleet of yellow buses arrives each morning carrying the vast majority of students, many wearing the maroon school colors of the Eagles.
The students are 57 percent Latino and 37 percent white, with a small number of Black students and fewer of other races. More than three quarters qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.
Roosevelt was among the first districts in Texas to end remote learning, notifying parents on Sept. 22. All students had to return the following Monday. (A majority of Texas students attend school in person.)
Of about 140 students who were studying remotely, 15 withdrew from school because their families were worried about the health risks of in-person classes.
Seven others had already left the school district, located in a conservative and frequently Covid-skeptic part of West Texas, for the opposite reason: Their parents objected to a state mandate that all children 10 or older wear masks, Mr. Grimes said.
So far, the decision to bring everyone back into the classroom has improved performance, Mr. Grimes said. By the winter break, only 9 percent of high school students were failing at least one class.
But as performance has improved, the pandemic has intruded.
A large number of the district’s 170 teachers, administrators and other staff have tested positive for the coronavirus (52) or had to quarantine because of exposure (27), from the start of the school year through the beginning of January.
Absences have forced teachers to combine classes, serve lunch and even take out the garbage. Mr. Grimes, the superintendent, has had to drive a bus when the regular drivers tested positive or had to quarantine because of an exposure.
“We’re still recovering from Covid now,” said Tim Crane, the high school principal, who along with his wife, a special-education teacher, tested positive in early November. “My wife and I do everything we can, and yet we got it.”
As more schools across the country opened their doors in the fall, evidence has suggested that in-person learning has not necessarily led to widespread coronavirus transmission within schools — though the emergence of a new, possibly more infectious coronavirus variant has raised new concerns about reopening schools.
In Roosevelt, there is no regular coronavirus testing, but the district has imposed basic safety measures, including requiring masks, except when eating, and staggering arrivals and dismissals.
The greater risk has been infections outside of school. The surrounding community of Lubbock County had among the worst outbreaks in Texas during the fall, fueled by a mix of returning college revelers and local residents fed up with pandemic precautions.
No cases have been linked to contact at school, Mr. Grimes said. But contact tracing has been incomplete. Mr. Crane said neither he nor his wife heard from Lubbock County contact tracers after they fell ill.
And the community has not been immune from the pandemic’s toll: A bus driver, who tested positive at the end of a weeklong Thanksgiving break, died a few days later.
Cafeteria tables with seats for a dozen students are limited to three. Numbered lunch tables fill a school gym. Some students eat on the bleachers, at spots marked by blue tape.
The school does not have the space to maintain six-foot spacing in classrooms. And collaborative work, or a desire to gossip, draws students close.
“Guys, you’re going to have to sit down,” Kylie Martinez, an English teacher, told three students who were standing together in her freshman English class one morning last fall.
In the dim light of her second-floor classroom, students read quietly and answered questions on their laptops — a much larger part of life in the school this past year, and a way to keep students learning if they have to quarantine at home.
“As a mom, I was worried,” said Ms. Martinez, who has two young children attending the district’s elementary school. “I was concerned about them getting sick and us getting quarantined.”
So far, that hasn’t happened. But the pandemic has directly affected about one in three students: As of the second week in January, 53 had tested positive since the beginning of the school year, and another 282 have had to quarantine for two weeks because of an exposure.
“I’m in a big geometry class, and half of that class is in quarantine,” Madison Hermosillo, the sophomore who struggled with remote learning, said just before Thanksgiving break.
Madison has adjusted to the new routines of being back in school, from wearing a mask to sitting in an assigned lunch seat. After a few weeks back in school, her grades began to improve.
By the start of January, she was passing all her classes."

Schools in the Pandemic: A Report Card
The Board Voted to Keep Schools Closed. Parents Revolted.
The anger over the decision to teach fall classes remotely was spelled in chalk on Beth Martin’s sidewalk.
“OPEN THE SCHOOLS BETH,” an irate parent scrawled in July after ringing the front doorbell and confronting Ms. Martin, a retired librarian of 30 years and member of the local school board.
“She didn’t swear at me, but she yelled,” Ms. Martin remembered. “I had to call the police.”
So began a semester that Ms. Martin described as a series of heated clashes and coronavirus-related quarantines in Wausau, a city of 38,000 people in central Wisconsin.

Started the year remote, then moved to hybrid, with middle and high school students in buildings an average of two days a week.
After starting classes virtually, the school board bowed to community pressure and voted to open schools to students in November — just as the pandemic was surging across Wisconsin. Hundreds of students would be exposed to the virus in the community and forced to stay home for two weeks, although a district spokeswoman said there were no staff or student deaths. A few staff members who were hospitalized later recovered.
As the board struggled with difficult decisions, members turned on one another in a bitter quarrel that frustrated parents, making it and the administration a lightning rod in the community.
Similar conflicts played out across the country, as school board members accustomed to hiring superintendents and approving annual budgets struggled with the demand that they become instant public health experts, balancing teacher concerns about safety with the educational needs of students and burdens on working parents.
Parents in California, Salt Lake City, suburban Philadelphia and elsewhere sued school boards and local health officials, arguing that their constitutional rights had been violated by the decision to keep classrooms closed. A superintendent in Arizona resigned after death threats were made to him and his family when he closed schools there in December.
The discord could leave many school leaders and their communities with the formidable task of rebuilding and repairing relationships — amid rifts that were previously unimaginable — after the pandemic recedes.
Wausau, a small city on the Wisconsin River known for its granite quarries and ski hills, was the rare district in the region to choose remote learning this fall, with the board following recommendations from the superintendent and teachers’ union, which said it was the safest option. District officials expected other systems would quickly follow suit as cases surged, but they did not.
“We were all of the opinion that within two to three weeks of opening, we were all going to be virtual anyway,” said Keith Hilts, the Wausau superintendent.

Before the vote, school board meetings in Wausau, a district of 8,000 students, were typically polite, lightly attended affairs. But the decision to teach remotely seemed to cleave the community in two.
A vocal contingent of parents urged the board to reconsider. Its president, Tricia Zunker, was harassed, including on Facebook, where someone wrote that perhaps her mask should be adjusted tightly enough to stop her from breathing.
April Van Rixel, 28, whose daughter is in third grade, was one of the parents who pushed for in-person classes. She started a Facebook page where like-minded parents could organize and was the mother who confronted Ms. Martin at her house in July.
“We all started to band together,” she said. “We saw the turmoil in our children. The social and academic damage has been immeasurable. Why was that not the priority?” (Ms. Van Rixel added that she “got a little crazy” at Ms. Martin’s house and would like to apologize to her eventually.)
For months, the decision from July held firm: Teachers came to school but taught virtually from their classrooms, and students learned from home, on their laptops.
But officials worried that many families were abandoning Wausau’s public schools. More than 430 students — just over 5 percent — left the district when the decision was made to teach remotely. Some families, like Ms. Van Rixel’s, enrolled in a different school district, an option granted under a school-choice policy in Wisconsin, or switched to private school. Others moved away.

Class Disrupted

The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.
- What grade would U.S. public schools earn during the pandemic? To find out, Times reporters studied seven districts and the impact on students.Teacher shortages caused by outbreaks are shutting down schools.What does a more contagious coronavirus variant mean for education?Amid one pandemic, students are training for the next.
In Wisconsin, where funding is tied to enrollment, the exodus raised alarms over the future of the district. At the same time, parents pointed out that the spread of the virus in Wausau was comparable to that of nearby communities where students were attending in person.
And there were early indications that academic performance was suffering: Unexcused absences went up, and grades went down. High school freshmen received 856 F’s in the first quarter, compared with 189 in the same period last year.
After months of debate, the board voted to open the schools for hybrid learning in early November, giving families the option for students to be taught in the classroom on certain days or virtually. Dr. Hilts, the superintendent, supported the switch, deciding that in-person learning was safe with the right precautions. He was also swayed by a survey showing that about 65 percent of families in Wausau wanted some opportunity for in-person learning.
The decision came at a critical moment: By fall, the coronavirus was surging in Wausau, which had among the highest per capita caseloads in the country. In early November, the Wausau area was averaging 145 new coronavirus infections each day, according to a New York Times tracking project.
“We were going back to school just as the pandemic was getting worse,” said Ms. Martin, the board member.
Safety precautions were instituted, including a mask mandate for everyone and limited movement for elementary school children, who spent most of their days this fall in one classroom, including for lunch, art, music and science.
“Like everybody else, I was anxious,” said John Masanz, a high school English teacher and the president of the Wausau teachers’ union, which opposed the return to in-person classes. “I have to listen to a lot of different factions. I also have a senior in high school living in my house, and I knew that getting back to face-to-face instruction was important. I’ll be honest with you, I was torn.”
Since in-person classes began, hundreds of students and staff members have toggled back and forth between the classroom and home, observing a two-week quarantine if they had potential exposure. District officials said they had no documented cases of at-school transmission, but on Jan. 12, nearly 200 students and staff were in quarantine.
“Our community is not stepping up,” said Ms. Martin, noting that virus transmission remains high in Wausau. “I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop where we say, ‘You know what, we have to go virtual again.’”
For teachers, anxiety is “through the roof,” Mr. Masanz said. And so is tension in the community, which in November voted down two referendums that would have raised $158 million for capital improvements and other costs to the school district.
“I hope that we can get past this divide and come back together as a community,” Mr. Masanz said. “And get back to education as normal.”"

How Joe Biden Became a Steady Hand Amid So Much Chaos
In recent months, Mr. Biden’s restraint with words and his refusal to take the political bait laid by President Trump show a level of discipline as the 46th president faces a cascade of crises.
As a child, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. wrestled with words, grappling with a boyhood stutter. Years later, as a young politician, he couldn’t stop saying them, quickly developing a reputation for long-winded remarks.
It was words that undercut his first two campaigns for the White House, with charges of plagiarism ending his 1988 bid and verbal missteps that hampered his 2008 outing from nearly the first moments. And it was his self-described penchant for being a “gaffe machine,” as he once put it, that would cement his vice-presidential nickname of “Uncle Joe,” the endearing relative who prompts the occasional wince.
Through a nearly half-century-long political career marked by personal tragedy and forged in national upheaval, Mr. Biden’s struggle with his own words has remained a central fact of his professional life, and of the ambition he harbored for nearly as long, the White House.
Yet over the course of the 2020 campaign, and especially in the two months since his victory, Mr. Biden, the nation’s 46th president, has transformed himself into a steady hand who chooses words with extraordinary restraint.
The self-described “scrappy kid from Scranton,” who called President Trump a “clown” and told him to “shut up” during their first debate, refused to take the political bait laid by Mr. Trump for weeks after the election with his attempts to overturn the results. Rather than get sucked into the Trumpian chaos, Mr. Biden focused on announcing his cabinet and helping his party win two runoff races in Georgia. And with a second impeachment trial looming in the Senate, Mr. Biden, 78, has maintained his steadfast faith in the political center, positioning himself as a champion of all Americans and a deal maker between the left and the right.
“There’s more of a sense of a calm resolve now,” said Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Democrat of Delaware, who has known Mr. Biden for decades and served as a co-chair of his campaign. “Even the words that he uses that are fiery are very intentional now. He is where he is supposed to be at this moment.”
The coming year will test Mr. Biden’s self-discipline, as he takes office amid urgency from his own party to make a decisive break with the Trump era by pushing through an aggressive policy agenda in the face of a Republican Party that is looking to come together around a new opponent. Mr. Biden and his aides are staking much on his ability to find the right words to restore America’s reputation, win bipartisan support in Congress and unite an anxious nation.
Much of Mr. Biden’s inaugural address on Wednesday centered on calling the country to come together in the midst of many challenges, with some of his first words as president focused on issuing a plea to those who did not support his candidacy.
“Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart,” he said. “Yet hear me clearly — disagreement must not lead to disunion.”
Mr. Biden’s ability to steer and stay the course calmly through turbulence is a testament, say friends and family, to both Mr. Biden’s unabashed optimism and his deep belief in the importance of American political norms and traditions. The man who came to Washington at age 30 as one of the youngest senators in history now enters the White House as the oldest president in history, with more experience in government and legislating to guide his path than any leader in decades.
“He’s been around so long that now that he is going to be the leader of this country, he knows he must conduct himself with presidential composure,” said Chuck Hagel, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden’s who served as defense secretary in the administration of President Barack Obama and before that as a Republican senator from Nebraska. “He knows the only way we’ll be able to start to climb out of this hole is for the leader of the country to be seen as fair and open and not dwelling on the negative.”
That Mr. Biden finds himself in this role at all is an unlikely turn of events for a man whose political career seemed to have stalled or ended so many times, including when tragedy struck just after he won his first election to the Senate in 1972. But after 36 years in the chamber and eight years as vice president, he became a familiar figure in the country’s political consciousness. When Americans sought a way back to stability after four years of tumult, Mr. Biden felt like a comfort to many voters. As Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, one of Mr. Biden’s most important supporters in the primary race, is fond of saying and repeated in an interview on Tuesday: “We know Joe and Joe knows us.”
To Mr. Biden’s friends and family, his success at winning the White House is proof that there is something fundamentally reassuring about his character — his loyalty, his empathy and his experience — that Americans want after four years of an unpredictable and chaotic administration. Even when he misspeaks, they argue, it underscores his authenticity, the journey of a man who moved through the darkness of the losses of his young wife, baby daughter and adult son to remain optimistic about politics, the country and his own destiny.
“He has a backbone of steel. He has a tremendous amount of empathy and he seeks the better angels in humankind,” said Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden’s sister and closest political adviser. “His word is his bond.”
Mr. Biden’s remarks during his presidential bid did not always set as decisive a tone. A campaign trail refrain that “words matter,” a line intended to be an attack on Mr. Trump, seemed at times like a reminder to the candidate. Often rambling and spotted with verbal tics — Bidenisms like an indignant “c’mon man” and a gentle “God love ‘em” — his comments careened between dense policy proposals, praise for long-deceased political leaders, minor flubs and the occasional factual inaccuracy.
Republicans pounced on his rhetorical style, caricaturing Mr. Biden as too mentally frail for the job. Even some in his own party pointed to comments like his praise for segregationists and overly friendly interactions with women as a sign that Mr. Biden was out of step with the times.
And yet, throughout a long campaign, a global pandemic, a racial reckoning and a riot at the Capitol, Mr. Biden’s central message of moral and political restoration never wavered: Renew American decency. Return to good governance. And heal a divided nation. From snowy Iowa cornfields to socially distanced debate stages, the former vice president offered his “word as a Biden” that he could fulfill his campaign promises.
In the end, after a crowded primary packed with Democratic candidates pushing for structural transformation and a general election against a president determined to upend government, Americans selected a new president but rejected sweeping change.
While Mr. Biden has pivoted left with his party, he remains a centrist at his core, determined to unite a frayed body politic and persuade some Republicans to support his agenda. For much of the past half-century, Mr. Biden has found himself in the literal middle of American politics — in the central seat on the Judiciary Committee, in the center of policy debates in the Obama administration, at center stage in the presidential debates and now at the White House. He is a man both of and apart from Washington, deeply immersed in the mores, manners and maneuvering of the Capitol even as he spent decades commuting home to Delaware on Amtrak.
“He has the most unique insight into what motivates politicians and how they think than anyone since Lyndon Johnson,” said Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, who first met Mr. Biden as a young man. “He just spent so many decades engaging with politicians.”
More essentially, says Ted Kaufman, Mr. Biden’s longtime chief of staff and short-term successor in the Senate, Mr. Biden is a “healer” determined to bridge seemingly unbridgeable divides.
The political traits that would come to define Mr. Biden were present from the start. A Catholic son of Scranton, Pa., and Wilmington, Del., he has long mythologized his childhood in stump speech tales of “Grandpop Finnegan” and virtuous sayings from his father, a car salesman who struggled to find work.

Even in the 1960s, Mr. Biden was something of an institutionalist in a blow-it-up generation. In penny loafers and sports coats, he rambled around the University of Delaware and Syracuse University College of Law, a middling student with little connection to the civil rights movement and the other social activism of the time. He received five student draft deferments during the Vietnam War and was kept from service after a physical exam in 1968 because he had asthma as a teenager, according to his campaign.
“I’m not big on flak jackets and tie-dye shirts,” he told reporters in 1987, distinguishing himself from some politically minded contemporaries. “Other people marched. I ran for office.”
After marriage, graduation and a brief stint at a Wilmington law firm, Mr. Biden won a seat on the New Castle County Council. Shortly after his election, one of his colleagues quipped that Mr. Biden “was the only man he knew who could give an extemporaneous 15-minute speech on the underside of a blade of grass.” The local paper called him a “compulsive talker,” and his underdog race for the Senate in 1972 was labeled “Mr. Nice vs. Mr. Mouth.” Mr. Biden was, of course, the mouth.
He entered office just weeks after the death of his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi in a crash with a tractor-trailer. Reeling from the tragedy, Mr. Biden would make only a six-month commitment to the Senate, taking the oath of office from the hospital bedside of his two young sons. Mentored by Senator Mike Mansfield, then the majority leader, he eventually found himself swept into the business of the body, with a plum seat on the Foreign Relations Committee — an early move that would later cement his reputation as an expert in American foreign policy.
In Washington, Mr. Mouth found much to discuss. A legendary profile by the future celebrity biographer Kitty Kelley in 1974 featured Mr. Biden openly discussing dating, sex and his late wife. (Mr. Biden would later talk about that period in his life as a haze of rage and anger, saying he felt like a “sucker” for sharing so much.)
His personal life stabilized after his marriage to his second wife, Jill, and the birth of a fourth child, their daughter Ashley. But his political career continued along an uneven course.
Mr. Biden’s greatest early failure and biggest success intertwined in 1987: the humiliation of a failed presidential bid and his victory as the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in stopping Robert Bork’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden announced his campaign was over during a break from the hearing, where his strategy focused on persuading Republicans to block President Ronald Reagan’s nominee.
Four years later, Mr. Biden would again make overtures to his Republican colleagues during Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings, allowing harsh and invasive questioning of Anita Hill, the law professor who accused the nominee of sexual harassment. Mr. Biden would later express “regret” for the treatment she endured but insist he did not mistreat her.
“If you go back to what I said, and didn’t say, I don’t think I treated her badly,” he said in an interview shortly after beginning his presidential bid in April 2019.
As he progressed through what would ultimately be six terms in the Senate, Mr. Biden became known for his willingness to reach across the aisle to craft legislation like the Violence Against Women Act and the 1994 crime bill and as a crucial voice in American conflicts overseas. The Senate became his professional home, reinforcing his unshakable belief in the value of personal relationships — the power of his deal-making words — in the service of bipartisan compromise.
Another presidential bid in 2008 ended in failure, marked by impolitic comments like calling Mr. Obama, who was then one of his rivals in the primary, “articulate and bright and clean.” But his years on Capitol Hill and in foreign policy, and his connection with white working-class voters, later won him a place on Mr. Obama’s presidential ticket.
During the Obama administration, Mr. Biden settled into the role of elder statesman and experienced voice on foreign policy. He led negotiations with Senator Mitch McConnell and congressional Republicans over the economic stimulus plan and budget deals. Still, some of his most memorable moments grew out of unsanctioned honesty — like breaking with the administration’s official position by saying in 2012 that he was “absolutely comfortable” with gay marriage.
In 2015, Mr. Biden mulled making a third bid for the White House, but the death of his son, Beau, from brain cancer that May was a devastating blow that Mr. Biden said left him emotionally unable to mount an effective campaign.
By the time Mr. Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a surprise ceremony at the end of his second term, praising his vice president as a “lion of American history,” the event seemed to mark a tearful end to Mr. Biden’s political ambitions.
In the end, it was that faith in his own character and experience that persuaded Mr. Biden to make a third run at the White House. Five months before announcing his bid with a three-and-a-half-minute video casting the election as a national emergency, Mr. Biden described himself as the “most qualified person” for the job. When confronted by a moderator with a list of his possible political liabilities, he dismissed them all as minor issues compared with the huge problems faced by the country.
“I am a gaffe machine, but my God, what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can’t tell the truth,” he said during a stop on his book tour in 2018. “The question is, what kind of nation are we becoming?”
That sense of history wasn’t lost on Mr. Biden on Tuesday when he made an emotional goodbye to his home state. With remarks recalling the national unrest before his Senate victory in 1972, his trip to Washington for his 2009 inauguration as vice president and memories of his deceased son, Mr. Biden teared up before even uttering a sentence.
“I’ll always be a proud son of Delaware,” he said, choking up as he drew on a phrase from James Joyce and the tears began to flow. “Excuse the emotion, but when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart.”
Presidents rarely utter such pointed words about their own mortality. But the moment was classic Biden, sharing his pain as he sought to connect with others.
The next president wiped his eyes once more and headed to Washington."

To assess how public schools have navigated the pandemic and the impact on students, The Times examined seven representative districts. The answers were strikingly different.
What does it mean to go to public school in the United States during the pandemic?
The answer looks so different in different parts of the country, it is hard to tell that we are one nation.
In some rural and suburban areas, especially in the South, Midwest and Great Plains, almost all students began the 2020-21 academic year attending school in person, and they have continued to do so, except for temporary closures during outbreaks.
In many cities, the bulk of students haven’t been in a classroom since March. And in some districts, like New York City, only younger students have the option of going to school in person, with many attending only part-time.
With little guidance from the federal government, the nation’s 13,000 districts have largely come up with their own standards for when it is safe to open schools and what virus mitigation measures to use. Those decisions have often been based as much on politics as on public health data.
- 13,000 School Districts, 13,000 Approaches to Teaching During Covid
- In Los Angeles, Teachers and Students Struggle With ‘No Human Contact’
- A School District Vowed to Stay Open, Until Its Staffing Ran Out
- ‘The Word of the Year Is Fluid’: The Pandemic Brings a New Teaching Style
- With Students Missing Online Classes, Teachers Are Going to Students
- Providence Kept Classrooms Open, and the Students Came Back
- The Board Voted to Keep Schools Closed. Parents Revolted.
- What One District Did to Prevent Students From Failing
Through all of this, there has been no official accounting of how many American students are attending school in person or virtually. We don’t know precisely how many remote students are not receiving any live instruction, or how many students have not logged into their classes all year. Nor has the federal government tracked how many coronavirus cases have been identified in schools or which mitigation methods districts are using.
While it is clear that many students learning remotely are falling behind, few districts have comprehensively assessed where their students are, and what skills they have and have not learned since schools across the country closed last March. As a result, we don’t know what approaches to remote instruction have worked or failed.
But some of the early data is deeply troubling. In Houston, the nation’s seventh-largest public school district, which began the year remotely, 42 percent of students received at least one F in the first grading period in the fall, compared with 26 percent in the fall of 2019.
In the Saint Paul Public Schools in Minnesota, where nearly all students have been learning remotely since the start of this school year, 32 percent of grades given in high school core courses in the first quarter were failing marks, up from 12 percent the year before.
And Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, where classes were virtual all fall, found that the percentage of middle and high school students who failed two or more classes in the first quarter increased 83 percent from the first quarter of the previous year. The increase was even greater among students with disabilities and students learning English.
The disruption of education, like so much else about the pandemic, has not affected everyone equally. Districts serving high percentages of nonwhite or poor students were significantly more likely to remain fully remote this fall than other districts.
For many of the students who have not set foot in school since March, in-person education also represents a critical safety net — a source of food and other basic necessities, a place with caring adults who will notice signs of abuse or neglect — from which they are now cut off.
And the limited data from assessments and grades this fall suggest that disadvantaged students have lost the most ground during months of remote learning.
“Lower-income kids, kids of color, kids with unique needs like those who have a disability or other challenges — the numbers look very, very bad,” said Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a research and policy organization based at the University of Washington Bothell.
Students are not suffering just academically. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the proportion of mental-health-related visits among all visits to emergency rooms by children 5 to 17 years old increased significantly from April to October, compared with those months in 2019.
To give readers a sense of the varying ways the pandemic has affected students, families, teachers and school staff, The New York Times has profiled seven districts across the country, looking at how each responded in differing ways to the challenges of educating children in the pandemic.
Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second largest, has operated remotely all fall, citing the city’s high rate of virus transmission. With cases still very high and hospitals overwhelmed, it seems unlikely that the district, where most students are Latino, will return to in-person learning anytime soon.
Cherokee County, Ga., a mostly white suburban district, offered in-person instruction all fall, though several of its schools switched to remote learning temporarily because of outbreaks, and the entire district was closed for at least two weeks following winter break as staffing shortages mounted. Wausau, Wis., a small, majority-white district in a state that found itself one of the worst virus hot spots for a period in the fall, vacillated between in-person and remote instruction.
In the District of Columbia Public Schools, a majority Black district, we followed efforts to re-engage students during a semester of all-remote instruction. In Providence, R.I., the governor’s push for schools to open allowed its mostly Hispanic students to come back to class, unlike in other Northeastern cities, even as the state experienced a dangerous new surge.
Roosevelt Independent School District, a tiny, rural, mostly Latino district in West Texas, made the fraught decision to require all students to return to school in person to combat a wave of academic failures. Edison, N.J., a large suburban district where a majority of the students are Asian, has struggled to make hybrid education work.
Although education experts still have only a cloudy understanding of the impact of the coronavirus on learning, they have gained some clarity about the conditions under which schools can open safely.
Evidence has increased that schools, particularly elementary schools, are unlikely to seed transmission when community spread is at moderate or low levels — provided they use mitigation strategies, including mask requirements, social distancing and good ventilation.
But in places where the virus has surged, officials say they have seen more transmission in schools, especially in higher grades. High school sports have been a particular source of infections, leading some states to suspend them, outraging many parents.
The increasing evidence that some schools could operate safely was good news for districts where students were faltering under remote learning. Unfortunately, it emerged just as a new wave of infections picked up and then quickly engulfed the country late last year and into the new one.
Many superintendents have watched the rising cases with anguish, as they saw their hopes of bringing more students back to school in the near future threatened.
“It doesn’t feel good to know that children need you — children that you dedicated your life to absolutely need you — and you can’t be there for them in the ways you normally could and would,” said Sharon L. Contreras, the superintendent of Guilford County Schools, North Carolina’s third-largest district.
As we enter 2021, vaccines are likely to change the picture — but more slowly than Dr. Contreras and many educators, parents and children would want.
Although many states are prioritizing educators for the vaccine, it will take months for all teachers to be fully vaccinated — leaving aside those who decline — and most children will likely not be vaccinated until fall at the earliest.
At the same time, a new variant of the coronavirus that is thought to be more contagious is spreading in the United States, complicating efforts to reopen classrooms.
All this means that many schools will likely continue to require masks and social distancing well into the 2021-22 school year. And while few districts have said so explicitly, many students may not see teachers or classmates in person until the fall.

Well Challenge Day 7
To Start a New Habit, Make It Easy
Removing obstacles makes it more likely you’ll achieve a new health goal. The 7-Day Well Challenge will show you how.
Whether your goal for the new year is to lose weight, start exercising or focus on self-care, ask yourself: How can I make this easier?
In the scientific study of habit formation, the thing that makes it harder for you to achieve your goal is called friction. Reducing friction means removing an obstacle or coming up with a strategy that makes a task easier to do. And if you figure out how to make a goal easier, you’re more likely to succeed.
Friction typically comes in three forms — distance, time and effort. For instance, living far from the gym or a favorite walking trail makes it less likely that you’ll go. (One study found that people who lived 5.1 miles from the gym went only once a month, but those who lived within 3.7 miles went five times a month or more.) Time constraints can also get in the way of new healthy habits. If you don’t have much free time, it’s harder to start meditating or working out. And if something requires a lot of effort — like healthful cooking in a disorganized kitchen — you’re less likely to do it.
Sometimes adding friction to your life helps you achieve a goal. In one study, slowing down elevator doors by 26 seconds prompted more people to take the stairs. Removing vending machines from schools makes it harder for teens to snack on junk food or drink sugary soda.
“The friction you set up or remove in the environment is going to have an effect long after you’ve gotten discouraged and are less excited about the new behavior,” said Wendy Wood, a research psychologist at the University of Southern California and author of “Good Habits, Bad Habits.” “That’s why friction is so powerful. It persists.”
Pandemic life has altered many of our routines — so friction that used to be there may have disappeared, and new challenges may have added new friction. For instance, some people no longer commute to work, giving them more time to do other things. While online schooling has made life tough on many parents, families also may have fewer extracurricular obligations, making it easier to have dinner at home. To identify the friction that may be stopping you from achieving your goals, take a moment to think about the time, distance and effort the goal requires.
“Ask yourself, ‘What would make it easier for me to do this?’” said Dr. Wood. “You want to reduce the effort. The thing about friction is we often don’t focus on it when we’re changing our behavior. We focus on ourselves and keeping ourselves motivated and exerting willpower. But you have to recognize that you’re also going to be influenced by the things going on around you.”
For today’s final Well Challenge, try to make a new habit a little easier with these friction-busting ideas.
Day 7
Make Your Life Easier
Everybody has different goals for better health. Here are several different ways you can create a new health habit with less effort. Choose one or several to try or come up with your own easy health resolution.
Sleep in your workout clothes. If you’re trying to start a morning exercise routine, make it easy to get dressed for a morning run or workout. Sleep in some or all of your workout clothes. Put your shoes and socks by the bed. It’s one less obstacle to slow you down in the morning.
Put hand weights by your desk. Keep light hand weights nearby and do some reps while you’re on a conference call.
Hang hooks by your door. Whether you’re always losing your keys or forgetting your mask, creating a station of hooks or shelves by the door for masks, keys or any other essentials you need when you leave the house will help you make mask-wearing a habit.
Put extra masks in your coat pockets. I bought a pack of disposable masks and always have a half-dozen stuffed in the pockets of my coats. You never know when you might drop a mask on the ground, decide you want to double mask or offer a mask to someone in need. Over the summer my daughter rode a bike to meet me for an outdoor dinner and her mask blew away. She knew I’d have a replacement handy.
Stand on one leg while brushing your teeth. Standing on one leg while brushing your teeth is a way to practice balance. (Change legs after a minute of brushing.) Or use tooth-brushing time to practice mindfulness. You can find a tooth-brushing meditation here. When you add a new habit (like meditation or a balance exercise) to an old habit (like brushing your teeth) it’s called “stacking.” Stacking your habits makes them easier to remember.
Buy kitchen tongs. You’ll be amazed how much easier it is to cook, toss a salad or serve noodles with the right set of tongs. In general, having the right gadgets for your kitchen is a way to make cooking easier, and easy is good. Read “These Are the Only Kitchen Tools You’ll Need,” from Julia Moskin, or check out Wirecutter’s advice for the best kitchen tools.
Organize your refrigerator. Often the tipping point in a kitchen is the refrigerator. When your fridge is a mess, it’s hard to know what you have available to cook, what food might spoil soon and what you need from the store. Wirecutter has the best fridge organization advice from Marguerite Preston, a former pastry chef, who knows how professional chefs organize a kitchen. “In restaurants, organization is important not only because it helps cooks move quickly and smoothly, but also because wasted food is wasted money,” she writes. “The same is true at home. You may not see the effects of a chaotic fridge in a bad Yelp review or a balance sheet, but they will show in the time it takes to cook dinner and the stress involved.”
Watch the jellyfish. One of the best mindfulness tips I came across this year was from Cord Jefferson, the television writer who thanked his therapist on national television when he won an Emmy. Mr. Jefferson told me he struggled with traditional meditation, but he enjoys watching the feed from a web camera showing the jellyfish at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Bookmark the jelly-cam on your phone or laptop browser and get lost in the jellyfish for a short mindfulness break during your workday.
Do the Standing 7-Minute Workout. All you need is a wall and a chair nearby for balance. You don’t even have to change your clothes. Our new workout video is a friction-busting workout for anyone who avoids exercise because it’s hard to get up from the floor after a push-up, plank or situps.
Complete a 1-minute task. One of my favorite health tips for dealing with stress is the one-minute rule. It comes from Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before,” a book about forming new habits. This simple advice helps you decide what to tackle on a long to-do list. Just do the one-minute tasks first. Hang up a coat. Read some emails. Clear and wipe the kitchen counter. Tidy a book shelf. Whenever you take on a one-minute task, you’ll get a sense of accomplishment and quick boost of happiness.
Do a five-finger meditation. This is an easy way to calm yourself, no matter where you are. (I tried it in a dentist chair, and it worked for me!) Start by holding your hand in front of you, fingers spread. Using your index finger on the other hand, start tracing the outline of your hand. Trace up your pinkie, and down. Trace up your ring finger and down. As you do this, breathe in as you trace up, and out as you trace down. Continue finger by finger until you’ve traced your entire hand. Now reverse the process and trace from your thumb back to your pinkie, making sure to inhale as you trace up, and exhale as you trace down. You can find more tips for beating stress in my story, “Peak Anxiety? Here Are 10 Ways to Calm Down.”
Create a Sunday basket. I learned this tip from Lisa Woodruff, author of “The Paper Solution.” She suggests dumping your bills, receipts and various papers into a basket. (She sells a product for this, but I just use a regular basket.) Once a week, sort your actionable papers (those that need attention) from your archive papers (those that can be filed.) The Sunday basket approach (she claims it will add five extra hours to your week) is part of a larger system proposed by Ms. Woodruff that uses three-ring binders rather than a filing cabinet. (She suggests five binders for financial information, medical needs, household reference, school items and daily operations.) For me, the Sunday basket is enough, but if you feel chronically overwhelmed by paper, you can learn more on the Organize365.com website.
Buy partially prepared food. Buying chopped up food and meal kits costs more, but it does save time. “I always used to avoid buying cut fruits and vegetables in the grocery store, but I found I actually use them sooner, so in the end it kind of pays off,” said Dr. Wood.
Keep a tip jar. Tipping in person (rather than by credit card) is an easy way to add a gratitude practice to a delivery day. Pandemic life has meant a lot more deliveries to my door, but I never had cash, so I usually just added the tip to the card. I decided to create the tip jar and make an effort to tip in cash. What I didn’t anticipate is that I would get so much more enjoyment out of tipping in person. (I always wash my hands first, wear a mask at the door and keep it brief.)
Put a notebook and pen by your bed. Keeping pen and paper by your bedside allows you to do a nightly stress-dump of all the things on your mind that might otherwise keep you up at night. You get a head start on tomorrow by creating a to-do list. And you can end your day with a simple gratitude practice — writing down three things for which you are grateful.
Create a device charging station outside your bedroom. The blue light in your screen has the same effect on your brain as sunlight, which means it wakes you up just when you want to be drifting off. If you’re trying to cut back on screens at bedtime, add some friction by setting up a charging station in your work area, the kitchen — anywhere but your bedroom. “If it’s in the bedroom, it’s easier to use,” said Dr. Wood. “That’s part of the temptation of always staying online. Keep devices out of the bedroom.”"

A Call for Unity to a Nation Facing a Pandemic and Division
In his Inaugural Address, President Biden spoke of a return to the ordinary discord of democracy, with a reminder that “politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path.”
WASHINGTON — In the end, the inauguration triumphed over the insurrection.
President Biden’s plea for national unity in his Inaugural Address on Wednesday was rooted in a belief — born of decades working inside the fractious institutions of government — that America can return to an era where “enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward.”
It was a call for the restoration of the ordinary discord of democracy, with a reminder that “politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path.” The words were made all the more potent because they were delivered from the same steps at the entrance to the Capitol where a violent attack two weeks ago shocked the nation into realizing the lengths to which some Americans would go to overturn the results of a democratic election.
Mr. Biden’s inauguration was notable for its normalcy, and the sense of relief that permeated the capital as an era of constant turmoil and falsehood ended. Yet he takes office amid so many interlocking national traumas that it is still unclear whether he can persuade enough of the nation to walk together into a new era. To do so, he needs to lead the country past the partisan divisions that made mask-wearing a political act, and to win acceptance from tens of millions of Americans who believed a lie that the presidency had been stolen.
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is hardly the first president to take office in a moment of national desperation and division. Lincoln, whose inauguration amid fear of violence hung over this moment, faced a country fracturing into civil war. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was in his third term when Mr. Biden was born, faced a nation mired in depression, with “Hoovervilles” in the shadow of the Capitol.
While Mr. Biden does not face a single crisis of equal magnitude, he made clear — without quite making the comparison — that none of his predecessors confronted such a fearsome array of simultaneous trials.
He listed them: a devastating pandemic that in one year has killed more Americans than the nation lost during World War II (he could have added Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan), an economic downturn that brought with it “joblessness and hopelessness,” a crisis of racial justice and another of climate, and, for tens of millions of Americans, a collapse in their faith in democracy itself.
And finally, he argued, American healing would require an end to partisan self-delusion, and to the era of alternative facts.
He never referred to President Donald J. Trump, but he was clearly talking about him — and the more than 140 Republicans in Congress who voted not to certify the election results, despite an absence of any evidence of widespread fraud — when he said that “we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.”
Mr. Biden’s presidency is predicated on a bet that it is not too late to “end this uncivil war.” Even some of his most ardent supporters and appointees, a generation or more younger than he is, wonder whether his calls for Americans to listen to one another, “not as adversaries but as neighbors,” are coming too late.
“Like Lincoln, Biden comes to power at a moment when the country is torn between conflicting visions of reality and identity,” said Jon Meacham, the presidential historian who occasionally advises Mr. Biden and contributed to his Inaugural Address.
“Too many Americans have been shaped by the lie that the 2020 election was somehow stolen,” he said. “The new president’s challenge — and opportunity — is to insist that facts and truth must guide us. That you can disagree with your opponent without delegitimizing that opponent’s place within the Republic.”
Mr. Biden’s speech was about restoring that world, one that existed in the America he grew up in. It is the argument of a 78-year-old who has endured tragedy after tragedy in public and who, in a reverse of the usual order, took on the manner of a statesman before he returned to the campaign trail as a politician.
But what millions of Americans hear as a heartfelt call to restore order, millions of others believe masks deep partisanship, or a naïveté about what has happened to America over the past four years, or the past 20.
In fact, beyond the call for unity, Mr. Biden’s speech was littered with phrases bound to reignite those arguments.
His references to the “sting of systemic racism,” to “white supremacy” and “domestic terrorism,” and his insistence that the climate crisis ranks among the nation’s top threats, were meant to signal to the progressive side of his party, which always viewed him as too conservative and cautious, that new priorities had arrived.
But they are also triggers to those who oppose him: Just on Tuesday, his last full day in office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a broadside on Twitter, where the president was silenced, against “woke-ism, multiculturalism, all the -isms — they’re not who America is.”
Live Updates
- Biden’s Education Department moves to cut ties with an accrediting body linked to a fraud scandal.
- Two Trump appointees are being investigated for posting reports denying climate change.
- Giuliani concedes that an associate did ask for $20,000 a day to help Trump post-election.
Mr. Biden planned his inauguration to declare the opposite, that they are the modern America.
And his anticipated actions in his first days in office — rejoining the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization, vowing to find a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants and to re-enter the Iran nuclear agreement — are meant to reinforce the point.
He paired that with a warning to American adversaries, who spent the past four years, but particularly 2020, filling power vacuums around the world as America counted its dead and took to the streets.
Mr. Biden cautioned them not to mistake the din of the past four years for weakness.
“America has been tested, and we’ve come out stronger for it,” he insisted, promising to “repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.”
But he never once mentioned the country that poses the longest-term challenge to American pre-eminence — China — or any of the array of lesser challengers seeking to disrupt, to build nuclear weapons, to undercut the United States by manipulating its computer networks or exploiting social media.
And in the parts of the speech that sounded more like a fireside chat than soaring rhetoric, he acknowledged that America’s diminished status could only be restored by ending the damage at home, and replacing an “America First” swagger with a dose of post-Covid humility.
The scope of that damage could be seen from the West Front of the Capitol. Gone were the throngs of hundreds of thousands who usually witness, and cheer, a ritual of American democracy that Mr. Biden was determined must look just as it always looks to the millions tuning in.
As long as the camera shots were tight, it did: the new president and vice president, the large family Bible, the chief justice, the former presidents. But the absence of Mr. Trump, the central, disruptive figure in the nation’s four-year drama, the first president in more than 150 years to refuse to attend his successor’s inauguration, could not be erased. Neither could the prospect of Mr. Trump’s second impeachment trial, an in absentia event that could start in days, perhaps reigniting the divisions that Mr. Biden came to heal.
When the camera shot widened, the “American carnage” Mr. Trump had vowed to end in his own inaugural speech four years ago was on full display, in ways that were unimaginable on Jan. 20, 2017.
The armed camp he had left behind was testimony to the divisions Mr. Trump left in his wake as he flew over the city one last time on Wednesday morning in Marine One, to the closest any American president has come to internal exile since Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974. (Mr. Trump’s last words to his supporters at Joint Base Andrews, “Have a nice life,” seemed to underscore his own inability to find a way to process the damage done.)
It wasn’t the empty National Mall that struck attendees as much as the miles of iron fencing, topped with razor wire and surrounded by thousands of National Guard troops. There was no more vivid illustration of the state of the nation that Mr. Biden was inheriting.
Sometime in the next few days and weeks, that fencing will have to come down. Mr. Trump’s trial in the Senate, most likely a brief one, will have to end.
Then will come the test of Mr. Biden’s declaration that “without unity, there is no peace.”
And while an array of leaders from both parties flocked to the inauguration and clapped at the sentiment, it is far from clear that the country is truly ready to move on.
In a nation that cannot seem to share a common set of facts, agree on the utility of simple masks, on the safety of vaccines, or that the presidential vote wasn’t rigged, fulfilling Mr. Biden’s dream of restoring orderly debate on policy may seem like the triumph of hope over lived experience.
“I am desperately grateful that the institutions of democracy have held, despite the damage President Trump and his enablers have inflicted these past four years,” said Kori Schake, a Republican who held positions in the Pentagon and the National Security Council and is now at the American Enterprise Institute.
“But for President Biden, the challenge won’t only be governing, but also restoring strength to the battered institutions of our democracy,” Ms. Schake said. “We Republicans have a responsibility to restore public trust in the integrity of our elections, because we’re the ones who called them into question.”"

How to (Literally) Drive the Coronavirus Away
What’s the transmission risk inside a car? An airflow study offers some insight for passengers and drivers alike.
Over the past year, as the health authorities have tried to curb the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers have trained their scientific attention on a variety of potentially risky environments: places where large groups of people gather and the novel coronavirus has ample opportunity to spread. They have swabbed surfaces on cruise ships, tracked case numbers in gyms, sampled ventilation units in hospitals, mapped seating arrangements in restaurants and modeled boarding procedures in airplanes.
They have paid less attention to another everyday environment: the car. A typical car, of course, does not carry nearly enough people to host a traditional super-spreader event. But cars come with risks of their own; they are small, tightly sealed spaces that make social distancing impossible and trap the tiny, airborne particles, or aerosols, that can transmit the coronavirus.
“Even if you’re wearing a face covering, you still get tiny aerosols that are released every time you breathe,” said Varghese Mathai, a physicist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “And if it’s a confined cabin, then you keep releasing these tiny particles, and they naturally would build up over time.”
In a new study, Dr. Mathai and three colleagues at Brown University — Asimanshu Das, Jeffrey Bailey and Kenneth Breuer — used computer simulations to map how virus-laden airborne particles might flow through the inside of a car. Their results, published in early January in Science Advances, suggest that opening certain windows can create air currents that could help keep both riders and drivers safe from infectious diseases like Covid-19.
To conduct the study, the research team employed what are known as computational fluid dynamic simulations. Engineers commonly use these kinds of computer simulations, which model how gases or liquids move, to create racecars with lower drag, for instance, or airplanes with better lift.
The team simulated a car loosely based on a Toyota Prius driving at 50 miles per hour, with two occupants: a driver in the front left seat and a single passenger in the back right, a seating arrangement that is common in taxis and ride shares and that maximizes social distancing. In their initial analysis, the researchers found that the way the air flows around the outside of the moving car creates a pressure gradient inside the car, with the air pressure in the front slightly lower than the air pressure in the back. As a result, air circulating inside the cabin tends to flow from the back of the car to the front.
Next, they modeled the interior air flow — and the movement of simulated aerosols — when different combinations of windows were open or closed. (The air-conditioning was on in all scenarios.) Unsurprisingly, they found that the ventilation rate was lowest when all four windows were closed. In this scenario, roughly 8 to 10 percent of aerosols exhaled by one of the car’s occupants could reach the other person, the simulation suggested. When all the windows were completely open, on the other hand, ventilation rates soared, and the influx of fresh air flushed many of the airborne particles out of the car; just 0.2 to 2 percent of the simulated aerosols traveled between driver and passenger.
The results jibe with public health guidelines that recommend opening windows to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus in enclosed spaces. “It’s essentially bringing the outdoors inside, and we know that the risk outdoors is very low,” said Joseph Allen, a ventilation expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. In an op-ed last year, he highlighted the danger that cars could pose for coronavirus transmission, and the potential benefits of opening the windows. “When you have that much turnover of air, the residence time, or how much time the aerosols stay inside the cabin, is very short,” Dr. Allen said
Because it’s not always practical to have all the windows wide open, especially in the depths of winter, Dr. Mathai and his colleagues also modeled several other options. They found that while the most intuitive-seeming solution — having the driver and the passenger each roll down their own windows — was better than keeping all the windows closed, an even better strategy was to open the windows that are opposite each occupant. That configuration allows fresh air to flow in through the back left window and out through the front right window and helps create a barrier between the driver and the passenger.
Latest Updates
- The Missouri Capitol may put a testing clinic in the basement as more lawmakers fall ill.
- Vaccines can be stretched, but it’s not easy.
“It’s like an air curtain,” Dr. Mathai said. “It flushes out all the air that’s released by the passenger, and it also creates a strong wind region in between the driver and the passenger.”
Richard Corsi, an air quality expert at Portland State University, praised the new study. “It’s pretty sophisticated, what they did,” he said, although he cautioned that changing the number of passengers in the car or the driving speed could affect the results.
Dr. Corsi, a co-author of the op-ed with Dr. Allen last year, has since developed his own model of the inhalation of coronavirus aerosols in various situations. His results, which have not yet been published, suggest that a 20-minute car ride with someone who is emitting infectious coronavirus particles can be much riskier than sharing a classroom or a restaurant with that person for more than an hour.
“The focus has been on superspreader events” because they involve a lot of people, he said. “But I think what sometimes people miss is that superspreader events are started by somebody who’s infected who comes to that event, and we don’t speak often enough about where that person got infected.”
In a follow-up study, which has not yet been published, Dr. Mathai found that opening the windows halfway seemed to provide about the same benefit as opening them fully, while cracking them just one-quarter of the way open was less effective.
Dr. Mathai said that the general findings would most likely hold for many four-door, five-seat cars, not just the Prius. “For minivans and pickups, I would still say that opening all windows or opening at least two windows can be beneficial,” he said. “Beyond that, I would be extrapolating too much.”
Ride-sharing companies should be encouraging this research, Dr. Mathai said. He sent a copy of his study to Uber and Lyft, he said, but has not received a response.

News Analysis
Trump Bequeaths Biden an Upended World
The sheen is off America. But betting against the country’s capacity for reinvention was never a good idea.
PARIS — Most countries lost patience long ago. The erratic outbursts of President Trump were unacceptable to allies when they were not simply insulting. Even rivals like China and Russia reeled at the president’s gut-driven policy lurches. Mr. Trump said in 2016 that America must be “more unpredictable.” He was true to his word.
The sudden infatuation with North Korea’s Stalinist leader, Kim Jong-un, the kowtowing to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the “Chinese virus” obsession, the enthusiasm for the fracturing of the European Union, and the apparent abandonment of core American democratic values were so shocking that Mr. Trump’s departure on Wednesday from the White House is widely viewed with relief.
The sheen is off America, its democratic ideals hollowed. Mr. Trump’s imprint on the world will linger. While passionate denunciations are widespread, there is a legacy of Trumpism that in some circles won’t easily fade. Through his “America First” obsession, he galvanized other nations to put themselves first, too. They will not soon fall back into line behind the United States. The domestic fracture that Mr. Trump sharpened will endure, undermining the projection of American power.
“Mr. Trump is a criminal, a political pyromaniac who should be sent to criminal court,” Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg’s foreign minister, said in a radio interview. “He’s a person who was elected democratically but who is not interested in democracy in the slightest.”
Such language about an American president from a European ally would have been unthinkable before Mr. Trump made outrage the leitmotif of his presidency, along with an assault on truth. His denial of a fact — a defeat in the November election — was seen by leaders including Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, as the spark to the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters.
A mob amok in the inner sanctum of American democracy looked to many countries like Rome sacked by the Visigoths. America, to foreign observers, has fallen. Mr. Trump’s reckless disruption, in the midst of a pandemic, has bequeathed to Joseph R. Biden Jr., the incoming president, a great global uncertainty.
“The post-Cold War era has come to an end after 30 years, and a more complex and challenging era is unfolding: a world in danger!” said Wolfgang Ischinger, the chairman of the Munich Security Conference.
Mr. Trump’s talent for gratuitous insults was felt the world over. In Mbour, a coastal town in Senegal, Rokhaya Dabo, a school administrator, said, “I don’t speak English, but I was offended when he said Africa is a shithole.” In Rome, Piera Marini, who makes hats for her store on Via Giulia, said she was delighted Mr. Trump was going: “Just the way he treated women was chilling.”
“Biden needs to tackle the restoration of democracy at home in a humble way that allows Europeans to say we have similar problems, so let’s get out of this together,” Nathalie Tocci, an Italian political scientist, said in an interview. “With Trump, we Europeans were suddenly the enemy.”
Still, to the last, Mr. Trump’s nationalism had its backers. They ranged from the majority of Israelis, who liked his unconditional support, to aspiring autocrats from Hungary to Brazil who saw in him the charismatic leader of a counterrevolution against liberal democracy.
Mr. Trump was the preferred candidate of 70 percent of Israelis before the November election, according to a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute. “Israelis are apprehensive about what lies beyond the Trump administration,” said Shalom Lipner, who long served in the prime minister’s office. They have their reasons. Mr. Trump was dismissive of the Palestinian cause. He helped Israel normalize relations with several Arab states.
Elsewhere the support for Mr. Trump was ideological. He was the symbol of a great nationalist and autocratic lurch. He personified a revolt against Western democracies, portrayed as the place where family, church, nation and traditional notions of marriage and gender go to die. He resisted mass migration, diversity and the erosion of white male dominance.
One of Trump’s boosters, the nationalist Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, claimed this month that in the American election, “There were people who voted three, four times, dead people voted.” In an illustration of Mr. Trump’s role as an enabler of autocrats, Mr. Bolsonaro went on to question the integrity of Brazil’s voting system.
Viktor Orban, Hungary’s anti-immigrant prime minister and a strong Trump supporter, told Reuters last year that the Democrats had forced “moral imperialism” on the world. Although he congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory, Mr. Orban’s relations with the new president are certain to be strained.
This global cultural battle will continue because the conditions of its eruption — insecurity, disappearing jobs, resentment in societies made still more unequal by the impact of Covid-19 — persist from France to Latin America. The Trump phenomenon also persists. His tens of millions of supporters are not about to vanish.
“Were the events at the Capitol the apotheosis and tragic endpoint of Trump’s four years, or was it the founding act of a new American political violence spurred by a dangerous energy?” François Delattre, the secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry, asked. “We do not know, and in countries with similar crises of their democratic models we must worry.”
France is one such country of increasingly tribal confrontation. If the U.S. Justice Department could be politicized, if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could be eviscerated, and if 147 elected Members of Congress could vote to overturn the election results even after the Capitol was stormed, there is reason to believe that in other fractured post-truth societies anything could happen.
“How did we get here? Gradually and then suddenly, as Hemingway had it,” said Peter Mulrean, a former United States ambassador to Haiti now living in France. “We’ve seen the steady degradation of truth, values and institutions. The world has watched.”
As Simon Schama, the British historian, has observed, “When truth perishes so does freedom.” Mr. Trump, for whom truth did not exist, leaves a political stage where liberty is weakened. An emboldened Russia and an assertive China are more strongly placed than ever to mock democracy and push agendas hostile to liberalism.
Toward China, Mr. Trump’s policy was so incoherent that Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, was left appealing to Starbucks, which has thousands of stores in China, to improve strained U.S.-China relations. Mr. Xi wrote last week to the company’s former chief executive, Howard Schultz, to “encourage him” to help with “the development of bilateral relations,” the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Mr. Xi no doubt feels some Trump whiplash. The president once called him just “great,” before changing his mind. China, after negotiating a truce in the countries’ trade war a year ago, came under fierce attack by the Trump administration for enabling the virus through its initial neglect and for its crackdown in Hong Kong. The administration also accused the Chinese government of committing genocide in its repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region of China.
Mr. Trump’s approach was erratic but his criticism coherent. China, with its surveillance state, wants to overtake America as the world’s great power by midcentury, presenting the Biden administration with perhaps its greatest challenge. Mr. Biden aims to harness all the world’s democracies to confront China. But Mr. Trump’s legacy is reluctance among allies to line up behind a United States whose word is now worth less. It seems inevitable that the European Union, India and Japan will all have their own China policies.
Capitol Riot Fallout
From Riot to Impeachment
- As this video shows, poor planning and a restive crowd encouraged by President Trump set the stage for the riot.A two hour period was crucial to turning the rally into the riot.Several Trump administration officials, including cabinet members Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao, announced that they were stepping down as a result of the riot.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 70 people, including some who appeared in viral photos and videos of the riot. Officials expect to eventually charge hundreds of others.The House voted to impeach the president on charges of “inciting an insurrection” that led to the rampage by his supporters.
Even where Mr. Trump advanced peace in the Middle East, as between Israel and some Arab states, he also stoked tensions with Iran. Mr. Biden has suggested that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt was Mr. Trump’s “favorite dictator.” But then America is no longer the world’s favorite democracy.
“Even if you say Sisi doesn’t give freedom, where in the world is there total freedom?” said Ayman Fahri, 24, a Tunisian student in Cairo. He said he would take Mr. el-Sisi’s brand of effective authoritarianism over Tunisia’s turbulent fledgling democracy. “Look at Trump and what he did.”
Mr. Trump called the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, “dishonest and weak,” whereas North Korea’s brutal Mr. Kim was “funny.” He did not see the point of NATO but saluted a North Korean general.
He exited the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement, and planned to leave the World Health Organization. He stood the postwar American-led order on its head. Even if the Biden administration moves fast to reverse some of these decisions, as it will, trust will take years to restore.
Mr. Ischinger said: “We will not be returning to the pre-Trump relationship.”
Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia and now deputy head of Mr. Putin’s Kremlin Security Council, described America as mired “in a cold civil war” that makes it incapable of being a predictable partner. In an essay, he concluded that, “In the coming years, our relationship is likely to remain extremely cold.”
But the U.S. relationship with Russia, like other critical international relationships, will change under Mr. Biden, who has deep convictions about America’s critical international role in defending and extending freedom.
Mr. Biden has described Mr. Putin as a “K.G.B. thug.” He has pledged to hold Russia accountable for the August nerve-agent attack on the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny — an incident ignored by Mr. Trump in line with his uncritical embrace of Mr. Putin. Mr. Navalny was arrested this week on his return to Russia, a move condemned in a tweet by Jake Sullivan, the incoming national security adviser.
Mr. Putin waited more than a month to congratulate Mr. Biden on his victory. It also took a while, but souvenir stalls at Ismailovo, a sprawling outdoor market in Moscow, now stock wooden nesting dolls featuring Mr. Biden and have dropped Trump dolls. “Nobody wants him anymore,” said a man selling dolls. “He is finished.”
The world, like America, was traumatized by the Trump years. All the razor wire in Washington and the thousands of National Guard troops deployed to make sure a peaceful transfer of power takes place in the United States of America are testimony to that.
But the Constitution held. Battered institutions held. America held when troops were similarly deployed to protect state capitols during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Mr. Trump is headed to Mar-a-Lago. And betting against America’s capacity for reinvention and revival was never a good idea, even at the worst of times.

81,https://www.nytco.com/company/diversity-and-inclusion/2019-diversity-and-inclusion-report/,"The New York Times is driven by a simple but powerful mission: to seek the truth and help people understand the world.
As we do this essential work, we are committed to fostering a diverse staff that reflects the society we report on. And we are committed to giving our people a workplace that feels inclusive and rewarding to all.
As part of that commitment, each year we publish data on the composition of our staff, and provide updates on the steps we’re taking to continue to build on our progress.
Our Data — Overview
Below is an update on the racial and gender composition of our staff. Breakouts for our business, news and opinion departments, as well as new hires, can be found later in the report.
The charts show our staff is steadily becoming more diverse across gender, race and ethnicity. Women now represent 51 percent of our staff and 49 percent of leadership. People of color now represent 32 percent of our staff and 21 percent of our leadership. Each of these numbers increased over last year, driven in part by the diversity of our new hires. Across the company, 53 percent of new hires in 2019 identified as women and 43 percent identified as people of color.
The charts also show that we still have gaps in representation at the leadership level, particularly of people of color. Continuing to ensure our new hires are a diverse group is important, but focusing on inclusion and career development is equally important to accelerating progress here.
Our Actions
Below are brief updates on how we advanced our ongoing initiatives in 2019, and instituted new ones.
Ensuring fair hiring. We have spent the past several years building clear, fair and intentional processes around hiring. These include requirements for recruiting diverse slates of job candidates, relying on diverse panels to assess them, and providing tools and guidance to remove bias from job descriptions and candidate evaluations.
Promoting and developing people equitably. Fairness in promotions and pay are essential to making sure everyone has the same shot at success. In 2019 we continued to strengthen our performance review processes with the aim of setting clear expectations and evaluating people consistently. Company leadership now reviews promotion and retention data at least quarterly. Similarly, we know that pay equity is an important part of a diverse and inclusive workplace, and we conduct pay reviews every two years to ensure fairness. Our 2019 analysis found no evidence of pay discrimination.
Diversifying our industry. In addition to fair processes and practices, we’ve continued to invest in diversifying the pipeline of future journalists. In 2018, building on our Student Journalism Institute, we launched our new Newsroom Fellowship, a one-year program to help a diverse mix of up-and-coming journalists develop skills and experience they can bring to news organizations across the country. Our second class is 60 percent people of color and 80 percent female. This is one way we’re working to diversify not just our own newsroom, but the broader industry, where people of color make up just 16 percent of journalists.
Fostering an inclusive workplace. The Times has put in place numerous policies and resources aimed at creating an inclusive workplace, and we continue to add to them each year. For example, we added gender-neutral bathrooms to our offices in New York and London last year in response to staff requests. We also expanded our trainings on unconscious bias to include inclusion and belonging. And our employee resource groups continued to host a wide range of events and strengthen our sense of community.
Beyond specific policies and resources, we focused on two broad areas related to inclusion in 2019. The first was on inclusive leadership, because we believe that creating an inclusive culture starts at the top. To that end, senior executives held regular discussions on progress and challenges across the company and shared examples of successful inclusion practices. The second area of focus was communication, to ensure employees know what’s going on and have a chance to voice their opinions. Here we significantly expanded our communication channels, including adding regular town halls and Q. and A.s with company and department leaders. We also established more ways for employees to share feedback, including sounding boards, office hours and other smaller forums.
Together these actions are making a difference. We measure sentiment around diversity and inclusion in our annual employee engagement survey, and have seen consistent increases over the last few years across all races, ethnicities and genders.
The survey also identified a new area of focus for our inclusion efforts in 2020: more effectively supporting our distributed workforce. The Times is headquartered in New York but has employees working in many locations around the world, and we need to do more to build an intentional remote and distributed work culture. The coronavirus pandemic has made this even more urgent. We have moved quickly and effectively to adapt to a more distributed workforce, but view this as an ongoing, long-term area of effort.
Our Impact
The effects of these actions on The Times’s workforce and workplace is clear. But our focus on diversity and inclusion is also evident in our journalism itself, where you see powerful, groundbreaking reporting and commentary on issues like race and slavery, textured portraits of lives, culture and communities, and candid explorations of our own past failures. The diversity of our staff makes our report deeper and richer, and better able to address the needs and experiences of our growing, global audience.
Though we’ve made progress, we know there’s always more to do. We will continue this work, which strengthens our journalism, our business and our culture.
Our Data — Detailed Breakouts
Notes on the Data
All data based on self-reported employee identification using E.E.O. race and ethnicity classifications. Data includes U.S.-based staff only, due to restrictions on demographic data collection in other countries where we operate. Data excludes printing-plant employees.
This year we’ve begun including nonbinary, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and Native American groups on the charts. Groups that make up less than 1 percent of the employee population are listed as “<1.”
Leadership accounts for approximately 10 percent of the total employee population, and roughly equates to director level and above in business departments, and deputy editor and above in the news and opinion departments.
Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding."
82,https://www.nytco.com/careers/newsroom/,"I have a connection to someone at The Times who can speak about my skills. Can I indicate this on my job application?
Yes. Workday, our application aggregator, asks you to indicate whether you know anybody at The Times when applying for a position. This will give the employee you’ve named the option to list him or herself as your referral.
You probably get hundreds of applications for each job. How do I stand out?
We encourage applicants to thoroughly read the requirements for each job they consider. Be sure you’re not applying to a position in which you have no comparable experience, and that you fully understand the job description. If you’re sure your qualifications meet the criteria for the position, prepare a clear, well-written cover letter that explains why you are a unique asset to The Times and (if applicable) amass exemplary clips that show off your best work. Be selective about your desired positions and focus on quality over quantity — you have a better chance applying to one well-suited position than you do to several for which you are less qualified.
I’m an aspiring journalist. Are there any points of entry for me at The Times?
The Times is dedicated to developing emerging talent. Our new Fellowship program and The New York Times Institute are two initiatives geared toward helping entry-level journalists build their skills and portfolios.
We also offer summer internships through the business side of the company. These positions on our technology, advertising, marketing, product and design and data teams provide interns with a valuable window into the industry and its challenges.
If I’m interested in an entry-level position, what are you looking for in terms of clips or a cover letter?
The Times is primarily interested in hiring journalists who have set themselves apart through skill and dedication to their craft. Journalistic skills vary — are you particularly skilled at data analysis? Can you maintain good relationships with sources? Are you the most trusted audio producer at your company? Do you have an encyclopedic knowledge of the last 50 years of Hollywood filmmaking? Tell us what sets you apart as a person, and then use your work samples to reinforce how those skills are an asset to you as a journalist."
83,https://www.nytco.com/company/people/,"To produce our signature journalism and dynamic products that stand apart, we need the finest talent in the world. At The New York Times, we employ journalists, developers, strategists, videographers, marketers, art directors and many others. We value employees at all stages of their careers who bring different perspectives and experiences to The Times."
84,https://www.nytco.com/journalism/,"We hire expert journalists and allow them the time and resources to create in-depth, independent, original reporting in the public interest. We provide the context and analysis that readers need to better understand what’s happening around them. We have lawyers covering law, doctors covering health, former U.S. Marines covering war, and economists and M.B.A.s covering the economy.
From our headquarters in New York to Houston and Silicon Valley, from the U.S./Mexico border to Baghdad, we report without fear or favor, and our investigations result in concrete, meaningful action, whether it’s sexual harassment, workplace culture and ethics or government programs and corruption.
While our news coverage helps people understand the world, our Opinion report helps people imagine the world as it could be, through rich discussion and intelligent debate. Our Opinion journalists are experts in their fields who offer informed viewpoints on significant issues.
Our breadth of coverage reaches well beyond news and politics. Since our inception, The Times has been a thoughtful and deep resource for topics that touch our readers’ daily lives.
Audiences around the world look to The Times for our trusted guidance on where to travel, what to read, what show to see on Broadway and where to stop for a bite beforehand. From books to dining, theater to film, our critics’ reviews are often the only reviews that matter."

What We Do
Hiring Process
- You apply!
Questions
Do I need a computer science degree to be an engineer at The Times?
No. There’s no one background we are looking for — from bootcamp graduates to career developers, English majors to people with an M.S. in computer science — if you have the skill sets we’re looking and your values align with ours, we want to talk to you.
I’m not based in New York — can I still apply?
Yes. While the bulk of our tech operation is based in our New York headquarters, our remote work policy is flexible. We have developers based in St. Louis, Denver, San Francisco and several other cities across the United States.
Is there a limit to how many positions I can apply for?
No.
Do I need a journalism background to work in tech at The New York Times?
It depends. The bulk of the open positions in technology do not require a journalism background. However, some of our roles work closely with the newsroom and require some journalism experience.
Will I be considered for roles outside of the one I applied for?
Yes. Our hiring needs change on a weekly, if not daily, basis. We will consider you for all open roles that you might be a good fit for, but we’ll always check with you if we want to move forward with you for a role you didn’t apply for.
Your Development
We equally emphasize the importance of developing software and developing people."

87,https://www.nytco.com/company/diversity-and-inclusion/,"People come to The Times to contribute to a worthy mission, and to work alongside incredible colleagues who excel in their craft. We also offer a number of benefits and programs that help to create a welcoming, rewarding and supportive community. These include:
Parental leave. The Times offers most employees fully paid leave to care for a new child — up to 18 weeks for birth mothers and 10 weeks for partners and adoptive parents — in addition to a comprehensive benefits package including health and retirement benefits.
Continuous learning. We offer $8,000 in annual tuition reimbursement and free access to online learning, as well as many in-house resources for employees to grow and develop their skills.
Employee Resource Groups.We have 11 employee-led groups for people who share identities and interests, ranging from the Arab Collective to Young Professionals. These groups help to build an inclusive community and host over 100 events a year.
Outreach. We are working to ensure a talented, diverse pipeline of rising journalists at both The Times and the broader industry. The New York Times Fellowship Program is a one-year work program for up-and-coming journalists. We also host the annual Student Journalism Institute for journalists of color, and support many outside organizations dedicated to increasing diversity in journalism, technology and the media.

Our Team
Our Work
Questions
I’m not based in New York — can I still apply?
Yes, on a case-by-case basis. The vast majority of our team is based in our New York office. But we have a smaller office in London, and work remotely with a number of team members located across the United States.
Is there a limit to how many positions I can apply for?
No.
Do I need a journalism background to work in marketing at The New York Times?
In most cases, no. Most roles within Marketing don’t require a journalism background. A small number of roles work directly with the newsroom, and in those instances some prior experience with journalism may help. Nevertheless, a passion for journalism’s mission of seeking the truth and helping people understand the world is a must for every role.
Will I be considered for positions aside from the one I applied for?
Yes. We will consider you for any role we believe you would fit — but we’ll always check with you to gauge your interest before we move forward.
What’s the difference between what T Brand Studio does and what Marketing does?
T Brand Studio is an in-house branded content unit within the Advertising department. They collaborate with brands, taking a journalistic approach to telling these brands’ stories through native content. In contrast, Marketing works with the Times brand itself."

The Times also had four finalists, in Public Service, International Reporting, Feature Writing and Feature Photography.
The New York Times won three 2020 Pulitzer Prizes, bringing its total to 130 awards. The Times’s winners for the 2020 awards follow:
- Michael Schwirtz, David Kirkpatrick, Dionne Searcey and our Visual Investigations team, including Malachy Browne, Mark Scheffler Christiaan Triebert, Evan Hill, Whitney Hurst, David Botti, Dmitriy Khavin and Drew Jordan, in International Reporting. Under frequent surveillance, they documented Russia’s “shadow wars” — bombings, murders, bribery, disinformation — across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The Visual Investigations team proved that Vladimir Putin’s military was deliberately bombing hospitals and civilians in Syria.
- Brian M. Rosenthal, in Investigative Reporting, for revealing one of the worst predatory lending schemes since the housing market crash, and the government inaction that allowed it to victimize immigrant cab drivers in New York and elsewhere as brought to life in this episode of “The Weekly.”
- Nikole Hannah-Jones of The New York Times Magazine, in Commentary, for “The 1619 Project.” Four centuries after the arrival of the first enslaved African, she illuminated the many contributions of black Americans, including the perfecting of democracy, and inspired a discussion about their role in American history, both among scholars and in the classroom.
The Times had four Pulitzer finalists, as well:
- The Times’s Climate Desk, in Public Service, for “War on Science,” documenting the Trump administration’s rollback of decades-old environmental and safety regulations based on research and expertise, and the harm caused by the exploitation of weaker rules and enforcement.
- The International Desk, in International Reporting, for revealing China’s top-secret plans for brutally repressing millions of Muslims in the far west, backed by high-tech surveillance and the pioneering use of AI for racial profiling.
- Ellen Barry, in Feature Writing, for “The Jungle Prince of Delhi,” the mesmerizing story of a family living in a crumbling palace and claiming to be heirs to a fallen kingdom.
- Mary F. Calvert, a freelance journalist, in Feature Photography, for her haunting photos of men sexually assaulted in the military.
Headshots are available for download at this link (enclosed photos come with a mandatory photo credit for one-time use with no archiving).
The Times has won 130 Pulitzer Prizes, far more than any other news organization. Details on previous years are available here."

102,https://www.nytco.com/press/more-than-half-of-all-american-adults-are-turning-to-the-new-york-times-to-help-them-navigate-this-coronavirus-crisis/,"New campaign recognizes the role Times reporting plays in rebuffing misinformation about the pandemic.
Today, The New York Times announced its largest quarter for subscriptions ever. Readers around the world are turning to The Times for news they can trust and the most useful guidance in record numbers. In March, well over half of all American adults came to The Times, and readers viewed 2.5 billion pages — almost twice what The Times sees in a typical month. As quality, original, independent news organizations are all seeing unprecedented audiences, we’re reminded that readers are looking for verified information about the coronavirus pandemic, turning to news organizations they trust at a time when misinformation about the virus continues to spread rapidly across the internet and our airwaves.
Misinformation and falsehoods continue to challenge how the public understands and navigates the pandemic, leaving many searching for trustworthy information to make sense of the world. To recognize the important work of bringing facts to light and the difficulty in doing so in this moment, The Times is introducing a new advertising campaign, “The Truth is Essential.” The campaign highlights investigative reporting that revealed how inaccurate details about the coronavirus spread; journalism that explained and exposed unfounded conspiracy theories out of Beijing and the United States; and expert analysis on the difficult but important measures needed to defend against the virus.
The Times first reported on the mysterious pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan on January 6. Since then, The Times has published several thousand stories from 1,100 journalists in over 20 countries. Our coverage evolved as our access to information grew and scientific knowledge expanded.
Readers can access the most important news and useful guidance on the coronavirus outbreak for free by logging in or creating an account at nytimes.com/coronavirus.
The campaign, which includes television, digital and social media advertising, was developed in collaboration with creative agency Droga5."
103,https://www.nytco.com/press/the-new-york-times-releases-its-dataset-of-u-s-confirmed-coronavirus-cases/,"The New York Times Releases Its Dataset of U.S. Confirmed Coronavirus Cases
The Times has made public its comprehensive dataset of coronavirus cases in the United States to help researchers, scientists, government officials and businesses better understand the virus and model what may come next.
Today, The New York Times has made one of the most comprehensive datasets of coronavirus cases in the United States publicly available in response to requests from researchers, scientists, government officials and businesses who would like access to the data to better understand the virus and model what may come next.
The Times initially began tracking cases in late January after it became clear that no federal government agency was providing the public with an accurate, up-to-date record of cases, tracked to the county level, of people in the U.S. who had tested positive for the virus.
The Times led effort has grown from a handful of correspondents to a team of several dozen journalists, including data scientists and student journalists from Northwestern University, the University of Missouri and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, working around the clock to record details about every case. The Times is committed to collecting as much data as possible in connection with the outbreak and is collaborating with the University of California, Berkeley, on an effort in California.
By Friday, March 27, The Times had tracked more than 85,000 cases in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories, over the past eight weeks. More than 1,200 people in the U.S. have died so far.
“We hope the dataset can help inform the ongoing public health response to the pandemic and ultimately, save lives,” said Dean Baquet, executive editor, The New York Times. “We believe the data may help reveal how Covid-19 has spread through communities and clusters; which geographic areas may be hit the hardest; and how its spread in hard-hit areas may offer clues for regions that could face wider outbreaks in the future.”
Over months, our journalists have recorded the details on newly confirmed cases as reported by state and local officials. Early on, the number of cases was relatively low, and the cases mainly involved people who had traveled outside the United States. As testing, which had been delayed by a variety of problems, became more widely available, the number of confirmed cases grew quickly. The virus began to appear among Americans who had not traveled, demonstrating the virus spreading widely within the U.S.
The Times dataset, which is available here, can be used for noncommercial purposes with attribution."

A cookie is a small text file (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to a user’s browser from a website’s computers and stored on a user’s computer’s hard drive or on a tablet or mobile device (collectively, “Computer”). A Cookie stores a small amount of data on your Computer about your visit to the Site.
We may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies on our Site to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.

A web beacon helps us to understand whether you came to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, measure successes of email marketing campaigns and improve our website performance. They may also enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your personal information.
